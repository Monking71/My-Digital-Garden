The Services:
- **User Interface (UI)**: Graphical, touch-screen, command-line interface, $\dots$
- **Program Execution**: Load programs from memory, and run them; end execution
- **I/O Operations**: Access data from files or I/O devices. For efficiency and protection, users cannot do so directly: OS services do that for us
- **File-System Manipulation**: Read, write, create, delete, search files. Access permission control
- **Communications Passing**: Communicate between processes/ *Shared memory* or *message passing* communication
- **Error Detection**: Errors occur in CPU, memory, I/O devices, user programs: OS has to detect, correct, report errors. Sometimes may decide to halt the system

- **Resource Allocation**: Multiple processes are running on the system and they should be allocated resources: CPU cycles, main memory, file storage, I/O device access
- **Logging**: Keep track of which programs are using what resources
- **Protection and Security**: Protect information between different users on the system. Make sure processes do not interfere. Control resource access. Security from outside: control access to the system

###### Graphical User Interface
Instead of entering commands directly, we could use a **Graphical User Interface**–a mouse-based (*usually*) window-and-menu interface

- The first GUI appeared in 1973
- Apple made GUI widespread in the 1980’s

**Touchscreen** is a form of GUI common on mobile devices

##### System Calls
**System Calls**: A well-defined interface to the services of an operation system, used by programmers and users.

Usually written in C or C++, but assembly is also used

###### Application Programming Interface (API)
Most programmers will not see the level of complexity of numerous OS services being used

APIs hide this away behind a set of standard function which are made available to programmers, for performing common tasks when developing applications

Input and output parameters are specified for each API function

***Theoretical Analysis*** = Estimating the time complexity or the running time of an algorithm

The *time complexity* or the *running time* of an algorithm expresses the total number of elementary operations, such as additions, multiplications and comparisons, for each possible problem instance as a *function of the size of the instance*

When designing Three Tier Software Architecture (**PAD**) you can use these UML stereotypes:

These can be used in a simple Collaboration Diagram like this:

With these stereotypes you can design components based on the Architectural Layers:

When drawing these diagrams keep in mind that “Entity Classes” aren’t always actual classes, i.e. they could be a DBMS.

- **Business Justification**
- **Roles & Responsibilities** - A PRINCE2 project must have defined and agreed roles and responsibilities with an organisation structure
- **Product Focus**
- **Management of Stages**
- **Management of Risk**
- **Scaling and Tailoring** - A PRINCE2 project must decide *how* to apply the method such that it is scaled and tailored to suit the project’s environment, complexity, importance and risk
### Project Aim, Objectives, Deliverables
Have 1 **aim** and many **objectives**
Each **objective** should take you closer to the **aim**
**Objectives** all require a deliverable, the ‘proof’ the objective is passed
**Objectives** should be SMART
	- **S**pecific
	- **M**easureable
	- **A**chieveable
	- **R**ealistic
	- **T**imely

### Scope
Define what you will and wont do
The aim and objectives should mirror the scope and drive the requirements

Software products are fundamentally more complex than physical products because they can keep changing throughout their life.

Fred Brookes - Characteristics of software, that makes it different:
- **Invisibility**
- **Complexity** - More complex that physical engineered products
- **Conformity** - Conforms to human "rules" rather than physical rules, human rules can change
- **Flexibility** - More flexible, has a high degree of change, but this brings further complexity

Initiation -> Feasibility Study -> Requirements Analysis
-> System Design -> Build -> Implement -> Maintain -> Kill

##### Waterfall Method
Underlying assumption:
- Documents have value.
- Unused software has value
Loads of documents (Business Modelling -> Requirements -> Analysis and Design)
Then the coding *after* (Build -> Test -> Deploy)

##### Alternative - Rapid Application Development (RAD) (agile?)
Small teams working fast and close to the user community building prototypes quickly and trying them out.
Essentially, just an iterative process where prototypes are made and users suggest modifications.

#TODO: Spiral Method??

##### The Unified Process
2000-2010
Repeat the Waterfall Model quickly over a number of **ITERATIONS**
Underlying assumption:
- Concentrate *only* on the **valuable** documents and **valuable** software

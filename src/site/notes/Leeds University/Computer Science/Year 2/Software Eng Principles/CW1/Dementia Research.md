### How Technology Can Help
Using technology to assist people with dementia can help relieve their carers from extra work and allow the patient to be more independent in daily life.
Implementing assistive technology as early as possible is found to help them get used to it and allow them to use it for longer. ? (Anon, n.d.)
#### Memory Problems and Daily Activities
**Non-Tech Solutions**:
- Sticky Notes + Signs (Often with Pictures)
- White Board
- Journal/Diary
##### Automated Prompts and Reminders
*opening text*
- Devices that detect motion
	- Using a pressure sensor/movement sensor to play a pre-recorded voice when they walk by. For example. you could set one to remind you to turn off the stove when you leave the kitchen. Or a reminder to lock the front door.
- Devices that play set reminders
	- A small speaker that routinely plays messages for you. Useful for daily reminders such as taking medication or feeding a pet.
- Accessing devices remotely
	- Allowing a carer/family member to be able to access these devices remotely to allow them to add new reminders such as one-time reminders.
##### Clocks and Calendars
Clocks that show whether it’s morning or evening and the date.
- Up to 44% of people with AD experience sleep disturbances, with other forms of dementia having similar or higher proportions. (Cipriani et al., 2015)
##### Medication Aids
- **Pill boxes (Dosette boxes)** - split all the doses into little compartments in a box to make it clear when and what medication to take.
- **Automatic Pill Dispensers** - Like the dosette boxes these compartmentalise the pills however, instead of being in small containers, the pills are locked inside a device that releases them at specific intervals – with an alarm – thus preventing someone from getting confused and taking the wrong pills. Some devices can also be set to only stop the alarm after the pills are taken. There are also more advanced dispensers that alert friends or family if the medication hasn’t been taken.

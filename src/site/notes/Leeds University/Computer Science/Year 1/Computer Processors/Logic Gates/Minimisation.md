The process of optimising logic circuits, this could be via:
	- The number of transistors
	- Number of different types of gates
	- Depth of a logic circuit
	- Fan-in/Fan-out

**Why?**
- There is a limit to transistor density on silicon wafer
- There is a cost implication for each transistor and gate
- There is a propagation time through logic gates
	- The greater the depth, the longer it takes
- Conceptual simplicity for bug finding
- Simple designs are less likely to go wrong

Registers are ‘special’ memory locations in a processor
- Much faster than memory access
	- Close to the CPU
- Doesn’t require as many bits to address
	- Not all machine instructions can reference the entire address space without using multiple words
- Few register (as few as 4) however modern computers may have many Kilobytes
- All computation is done on registers rather than RAM
- The **HACK** computer has two registers
	- **A** - Address Register
	- **D** - Data Register

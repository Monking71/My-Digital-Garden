A [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]] $f : A \to B$ is said to be $\color{red}\text{bijective}$ (or [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.28 (Injective)\|one-to-one]] $\color{red}\text{correspondence}$), if it is both [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.28 (Injective)\|injective]] and [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.29 (Surjective)\|surjective]]. We also say that the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]] is a $\color{red}\text{bijection}$

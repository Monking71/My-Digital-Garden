A [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]] is called $\color{red}\text{real-valued}$ if its [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.27.1 (Domain, Codomain)\|codomain]] is the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] of real numbers, and it is called $\color{red}\text{integer-valued}$ if its [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5.

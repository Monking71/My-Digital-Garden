The $\color{red}\text{complement}$ of a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] $A$, short $\color{red} \bar{A}$, to be the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] of all elements, that do **not** belong to $A$

To avoid Russel's Paradox (The [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] of all [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|5.1 Sets]]), we must define a *Universe* for which the compliment is [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] in.

>[!example] 
>Let $U$ be our fixed universe, which itself is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]], and let $\color{red} A \subseteq U$ be a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]].
>The $\color{red}\text{complement of }A\text{ in }U$ is the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] $\bar{A} \coloneqq U - A$

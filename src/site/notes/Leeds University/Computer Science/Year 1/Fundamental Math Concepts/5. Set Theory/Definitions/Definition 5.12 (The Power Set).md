The $\color{red}\text{power set}$ of a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] $S$ is the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] of all subsets of $S$, i.e.
$$
\color{red}
\mathcal{P}(S) \coloneqq \set{x\ |\ x \subseteq S}
$$
###### Notation
In literature, you may also find $\color{red} \mathcal{P}(S)$ denoted by $\color{red} \text{Pow}(S)$ or by $\color{red} 2^{S}$

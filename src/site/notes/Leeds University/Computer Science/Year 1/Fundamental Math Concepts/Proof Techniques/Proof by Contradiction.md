##### Definition
Suppose we want to show a statement of the for $\color{lightgreen} p$ is true. Suppose we find a contradiction $\color{lightgreen} q$ such that $\color{lightgreen} \neg{p} \to q$

Because $\color{lightgreen} q$ is false, but $\color{lightgreen} \neg{p} \to q$ is true, we can conclude that $\color{lightgreen} \neg{p}$ is false, which means that $\color{lightgreen} p$ is true

How can we find a contradiction $\color{lightgreen} q$ that might help us prove that $\color{lightgreen} p$ is true in this way

#### Components of a Data Model
**Structural Part** - A set of rules
**Manipulative Part** - Operations allowed on data
**A set of integrity constraints**
#### Terminology
**Relation** $\rightarrow$ *Table* $\rightarrow$ *File*
**Tuple** $\rightarrow$ *Row* $\rightarrow$ *Record*
**Attribute** $\rightarrow$ *Column* $\rightarrow$ *Field*
**Cardinality** $\rightarrow$ The row number
**Degree** $\rightarrow$ The column number
**Attribute Domain** $\rightarrow$ The set of values allowed in an attribute
	- Not necessarily a ‘set’ of values but a definition of what is allowed (e.g. ```character: size 8```)
#### Defining a Relation (The Schema)
${\color{lightgreen}R}=\set{{\color{blue} A}_{1}:{\color{red} D}_{1},{\color{blue} A}_{2}:{\color{red} D}_{2},\dots,{\color{blue} A}_{n}:{\color{red} D}_{n}}$
$\implies$ $\color{lightgreen} R$: A Relation
$\implies$ $\color{blue} A$: An Attribute
$\implies$ $\color{red} D$: An Attribute **Domain**
For example:
${\color{lightgreen} \text{Branch}} = \set{{\color{blue} branchNo}:{\color{red} BranchNumbers},{\color{blue} street}:{\color{red} StreetNames},\dots}$
**A Database Schema**: $\color{lavender} R=\set{{\color{lightgreen} R}_{1},{\color{lightgreen} R}_{2},\dots,{\color{lightgreen} R}_n}$
#### Properties of Relations
- **Relation Name** $\rightarrow$ ***DISTINCT**
- **Cell** $\rightarrow$ Contains ***ONE*** value
- **Attribute Name** $\rightarrow$ ***DISTINCT***
- **Attribute Value** $\rightarrow$ All from the ***SAME DOMAIN***
- **Tuple** $\rightarrow$ ***DISTINCT***
- **Order of Attributes** $\rightarrow$ ***NO*** Significance
- **Order of Tuples** $\rightarrow$ ***NO*** Significance, theoretically
#### Relational Keys
**Super Key** $\rightarrow$ *Any* set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row
**Candidate Key** $\rightarrow$ A *minimal* Super Key
	- e.g. A super key where if any attribute was removed it would no longer be a super key
**Primary Key** $\rightarrow$ The chosen Candidate Key to be used
**Foreign Key** $\rightarrow$ The primary key of a different table being used in the current table
#### Integrity Constraints
**Entity Integrity** $\rightarrow$ Each primary key should be unique
**Referential Integrity** $\rightarrow$ A foreign key must be a valid primary key of the referred relation
**Multiplicity Constraints**
- One-To-One,
- One-To-Many,
- Many-To-One, 
- Many-To-Many
**General Constraints** $\rightarrow$ The constraints of a domain (e.g. Age is a positive integer)
#### Views
A view is a virtual relation that does not necessarily actually exist in the database but is produced upon request, at the time of request
- Provides powerful and flexible security mechanism by hiding parts of a database from certain users
- Permits users to access data in a customised way, so that the same data can be seen by different users in different ways, a the same time
- Can simplify complex operations on base relations
##### Updating Views
All updates to a base relation should be immediately reflected in all views that reference that base relation
- If a view is updated, underlying base relation should also reflect the change
- There are restrictions on the types of modifications that can be made through views
	- Updates are allowed if query involves a single base relation and contains a candidate key the base relation
	- Updates are not allowed involving multiple base relations
	- Updates are not allowed involving aggregation or grouping operations

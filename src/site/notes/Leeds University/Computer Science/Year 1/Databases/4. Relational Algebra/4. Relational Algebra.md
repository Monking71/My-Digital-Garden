Relational algebra operations work on *one or more relations* to **define another relation** ***without*** changing the original relations
- Both operands and results are relations, so output from one operation can become input to another operation
- Five basic operations in relational algebra:
	- Selection
	- Projection
	- Cartesian Product
	- Union
	- Set Difference
	- Rename?
- Three secondary operations (Defined using the basic operations)
	- Join
	- Intersection
	- Division
##### Selection
$\rightarrow$ Single relation $\color{blue} R$, the predicate
$\implies$ Returns a smaller relation with only *tuples* satisfying the predicate are displayed
**For Example:** List all staff with a salary > 10,000
$\large{\color{red} \sigma}_{salary\ >\ 10,000}({\color{blue} Staff})$
##### Projection
$\rightarrow$ Single relation $\color{blue} R$, the desired attributes
$\implies$ Returns a relation with specific *attributes* removed ***AND*** duplicate *tuples* removed
**For Example**: Produce a list of salaries for all staff, showing only staffNo, fName , lName and salary details
$\large{\color{red} \Pi}_{staffNo,fName,lName,slary}({\color{blue} Staff})$
##### Union
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} R$ and $\color{blue} S$
$\implies$ Returns a relation that contains the *tuples* of $\color{blue} R$ ***OR*** $\color{blue} S$ ***OR*** both, ***AND*** duplicate *tuples* removed
**For Example**: List all cities where there is either a branch office or a property for rent
$\large\Pi_{city}({\color{blue} Branch})\ {\color{red} \bigcup}\ \Pi_{city}({\color{blue} PropertyForRent})$
##### Cartesian Product
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} R$ and $\color{blue} S$
$\implies$ Returns a relation that is the concatenation of every tuple of $\color{blue} R$ with every tuple in $\color{blue} S$
![Cartesian Product.png|250](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Year%201/Databases/4.%20Relational%20Algebra/images/Cartesian%20Product.png)
**For Example**: List the names and comments of all clients who have viewed a property for rent
$\large\Pi_{clientNo,fName,lName}({\color{blue} Client})\ {\color{red} \bigtimes}\ \Pi_{clientNo, propertNo, comment}({\color{blue} Viewing})$
$\small \text{Pretty sure this is wrong, cartesian product DOES NOT allow common attributes}$
##### Intersection
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} R$ and $\color{blue} S$
$\implies$ Returns a relation with *tuples* that are in both $\color{blue} R$ ***AND*** $\color{blue} S$
**For Example**: List all cities where there is both a branch office and at least one property for rent
$\large\Pi_{city}({\color{blue} Branch})\ {\color{red} \bigcap}\ \Pi_{city}({\color{blue} PropertyForRent})$
##### Set Difference
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} R$ and $\color{blue} S$
$\implies$ Returns a relation of the tuples that are in relation $\color{blue} R$ but ***NOT*** in relation $\color{blue} S$
**For Example**: List all cities where there is a branch office but no properties for rent
$\large\Pi_{city}({\color{blue} Branch}){\color{red} -}\Pi_{city}({\color{blue} PropertForRent})$
##### Rename
$\rightarrow$ Single relation $\color{blue} R$, the new name(s)
$\implies$ Returns the same $\color{blue} R$ but with changed attribute name(s) or relation name
**For Example, Relation Name**:
${\color{red} \rho}\ NewName({\color{blue} R})$
**For Example, Attribute Name**:
${\color{red} \rho}\ oldAttr\rightarrow newAttr,oldAttr2\rightarrow newAttr2(\color{blue} R)$
##### Natural Join
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} T$ and $\color{blue} U$
$\implies$ Returns a Cartesian Product with common attribute(s) used as a primary/foreign key
![Natural Join.png|300](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Year%201/Databases/4.%20Relational%20Algebra/images/Natural%20Join.png)
**For Example**: $ClientViewing = Client\ {\color{blue} \bowtie}\ Viewing$
##### Theta Join
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} R$ and $\color{blue} S$, a predicate $\color{lightgreen} \theta$
$\implies$ Returns a combination of Natural Join and Selection
- If $\color{lightgreen} \theta$ only contains equality operations $=$ then the term **Equijoin** is used
**For Example**: List all students exams where they got above 70%
$GoodGrades = {\color{blue} Student}\ {\color{red} \bowtie} ({\color{lightgreen} Result.grade > 70})\ {\color{blue} Result}$
#### Semi-Join
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} R$ and $\color{blue} S$, a predicate $\color{lightgreen} \theta$
$\implies$ Returns a Theta Join with:
	- Only the columns of $\color{blue} R$
	- Each *tuple* in $\color{blue} R$ is returned once even if there is multiple matches
##### (Left) Outer Join
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} R$ and $\color{blue} S$, a predicate $\color{lightgreen} \theta$
$\implies$ Returns the same as Theta Join **However!** if there is no foreign key in $\color{blue} S$ for the primary key in $\color{blue} R$ then the tuple is added *once* with the other attributes set to NULL
- Also, if a predicate is given, it becomes the new primary key to be used
![(Left) Outer Join.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Year%201/Databases/4.%20Relational%20Algebra/images/(Left)%20Outer%20Join.png)
**For Example**: ${\color{blue} R}$ $\huge ⟕$ $\color{blue} S$
##### (Right) Outer Join
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} R$ and $\color{blue} S$, a predicate $\color{lightgreen} \theta$
$\implies$ Literally the same as (Left) Outer Join but the ‘primary key’ is in $\color{blue} S$ and the ‘foreign key’ is in $\color{blue} R$
##### Full Outer Join
$\rightarrow$ Two relations $\color{blue} R$ and $\color{blue} S$, a predicate $\color{lightgreen} \theta$
$\implies$ The same as the other outer joins, if there isn’t a match from ${\color{blue} R}\rightarrow {\color{blue} S}$ then the $\color{blue} R$ tuple appears with all the $\color{blue} S$ attributes NULL and if their isn’t a match from ${\color{blue} S}\rightarrow {\color{blue} R}$ then the $\color{blue} S$ tuple appears with all the $\color{blue} R$ attributes NULL
#### Aggregation
$\rightarrow$ One relations $\color{blue} R$ and function(s) $\color{lightgreen} AL$
$\rightarrow$ $\color{lightgreen} AL$: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
$\implies$ Iterates the function(s) over a list (e.g. an attribute) in $\color{blue} R$
**For Example**:
$_{\color{lightgreen} sum(balance)}({\color{blue} credit\_acct})$
#### Grouping
$\rightarrow$ One relations $\color{blue} R$, function(s) $\color{lightgreen} AL$ and grouping attribute(s) $\color{red} GA$
$\rightarrow$ $\color{lightgreen} AL$: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
$\rightarrow$ $\color{red} GA$: An attribute
$\implies$ Performs an aggregation but groups together the attributes in the $\color{red} GA$, returning a graph with column(s) for the $\color{red} GA$’s and column(s) for the $\color{lightgreen} AL$
**For Example**:
$_{{\color{red} person\_name}\ \color{lightgreen} count(puzzle\_name)}({\color{blue} completed})$

#### File-Based Processing
![F-B P.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Year%201/Databases/1.%20Introduction/images/F-B%20P.png)
##### Limitations
- Separation and isolation of data
	- Each program maintains its own set of data
	- Users of one program ma be unaware of potentially useful data held by other programs
- Duplication of data
	- Same data is held by different programs
	- Wasted space and potentially different values and/or different formats for the same item
- Data dependence
	- File structure is defined in the program code
- Incompatible file formats
	- Programs are written in different languages, and so cannot easily access each otherâ€™s files
- Fixed queries/proliferation of application programs
	- Programs are written to satisfy particular functions
	- Any new requirement needs a new program
	- No provision for concurrent access
#### Database
The limitations in a file-based approach leads to database/**d**ata**b**ase **m**anagement **s**ystem (**DBMS**)
*Database*
	- A shared collection of logically related data (and a description of this data), designed to meet the information needs of an organisation
***DBMS***
	- A software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database
***Database** Application Program*
	- A computer program that interacts with databases by issuing an appropriate request (SQL statement) to the **DBMS**
##### History of Database Systems
###### $1^{st}$ Generation: Hierarchical and Network

###### $2^{nd}$ Generation: Relational

###### $3^{rd}$ Generation: Object-Relational, Object-Oriented

##### Advantages of DBMS
- Control of data redundancy
- Data consistency
- More information from the same amount of data
- Sharing of data
- Improved data integrity
- Improved security
- Enforcement of standards
- Economy of scale
- Balance conflicting requirements #what
- Improved data accessibility and responsiveness
- Increased productivity
- Improved maintenance through data independence
- Increased concurrency
- Improved backup and recovery services
##### Disadvantages of DBMS
- Complexity
- Size
- Cost of DBMS
	- There are free ones lol, PostgreSQL
- Additional hardware costs
- Cost of conversion
- Performance
- Higher impact of failure
#### Summary
- Limitations in file-based systems leads to database approach
- DBMS allows users to interact with databases
- There are many components and roles in database environments
- Before implementing databases, you need to be aware of advantages and disadvantages of DBMSs

**External**
- The user, completely independent of the database designer
***Conceptual***
- The schema for the database
	- The design of the tables, their relations
	- All the SQL that *makes* the database
**Internal**
- *Where* the data is, how to find it and how it is compressed
- The communications between the DBMS and the Database

#### Data Independence
![Data Independence.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Year%201/Databases/2.%20Database%20Environment%20&%20Architecture/images/Data%20Independence.png)**Logical Data Independence**
- Allows you to edit the database without needing to change anything in the External Schema
	- *Unless!* you $\color{red} \textit{remove}$ a column from a table
		- Then the External Schema will break
**Physical Data Independence**
- You can modify the Internal Schema massively without needing to change the Conceptual Schema
- If you:
	- Move the database to a new storage location (bigger hard drive)
	- Rearrange the layout of the files
	- Change the hashing algorithm
	- Change the compression techniques
- The conceptual level remains unchanged

#### Database Languages
***DDL***
- To *Create*, *Update* or *Delete* database objects with,
- **Data Definition Language**
***DML***
- To *Add*, *Update*, *Delete* or *Retrieve* data from a database with,
- **Data Manipulation Language**
#### Data Models
Model – representation of real-world objects and events, and their associations
##### Object-Based
###### Entity-Relationship

###### Object-Oriented

###### Semantic, Functional

##### Record-Based
###### Relational

###### Hierarchical

###### Network

#### Functions of a DBMS
- Data *Storage*, *Retrieval*, and *Updation*
- A User-Accessible Catalog
	- A catalog is the hierarchy above a schema
		- e.g. A catalog is a collection of schema’s, which are collections of tables
- Transaction Support
	- A *unit of work* performed within a database
	- Generally represents any change in a database
- *Concurrency Control* Services
	- Prevent simultaneous transactions from interfering with each other
- *Recovery*
- *Authorisation*
- Support for Data Commutation
- Integrity Services
- Services to *Promote Data Independence*
- Utility Services
#### Multi-User DBMS Architectures
Most common: **Client-Server Architecture**
**Client**
- Manages the user interface and runs applications
**Server**
- Holds database and DBMS
- Controls data validation and Database access
*Flaws*
- Client requires considerable resources to run effectively (Data processing)
- Significant client-side admin overhead
##### A 3rd tier is proposed
***1* - Client**
- Manages user interface
***2* - Application Server**
- Manages data processing and business logic
***3* - Database Server**
- Same as before
*Pros*
- Supports data independence

- Abstracts away from complexity
###### Objectives:
- **Convenience**
	- Making the computer easier to use
- **Efficiency**
	- Allowing better use of computer resources
### [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Professional Computing/Week 2.2 - Hardware/Early Computing\|Early Computing]] Systems
In the old days (1950s), computers were machines with vacuum tubes
- I/O by paper tube / punch cards
- User = Programmer = Operator
	- In modern systems the *Operator* is replaced by the *Operating* System

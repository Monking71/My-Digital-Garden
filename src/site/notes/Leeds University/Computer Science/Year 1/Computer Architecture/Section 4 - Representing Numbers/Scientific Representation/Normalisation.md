Where the ***[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Definitions/Most Significant Bit\|MSB]]*** is always a 1
This can be done by simply moving the ***radix point*** until there is a 1 in the ***[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Definitions/Most Significant Bit\|MSB]]***

The advantage of normalisation is that the ***[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Definitions/Most Significant Bit\|MSB]]*** doesn't need to be stored as it will always be a 1

All [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Floating Point\|Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Floating Point]] numbers are *usually* normalised

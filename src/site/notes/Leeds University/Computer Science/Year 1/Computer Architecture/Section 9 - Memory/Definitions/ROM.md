**ROM** ( Read Only Memory ) provides permanent data storage which cannot be changed.
It is non-volatile, requiring no power source to maintain it
- This means that data can be "wired in" during manufacture
	- E.g. library subroutines and systems programs
- This makes it expensive for small manufacturing runs

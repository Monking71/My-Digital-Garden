**Direct Access** moves to a general region of memory then uses [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Sequential Access\|Sequential Access]]
- Individual blocks have unique addresses
- [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Access Time\|Access Time]] still depends on location and previous location

**Static [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/RAM\|RAM]] ( SRAM )**:
6 transistors per bit
- Cells store bits using the same on/off logic elements used in the processor
- There are no charges to leak, so no refreshing is needed when powered
- Takes 3x more space than [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Dynamic RAM\|DRAM]]

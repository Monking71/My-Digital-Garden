**RAM** ( [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Random Access\|Random Access]] Memory ) is actually misnamed since [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Semiconductor Memory\|Semiconductor Memory]] is always [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Random Access\|Random Access]]
- It is really read/write memory
- It is volatile and so only useful for temporary storage
- It can be static ( [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Static RAM\|SRAM]] ) or dynamic ( [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Dynamic RAM\|DRAM]] )

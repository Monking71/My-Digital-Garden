	The fundamental properties, and the patterns of relationships, connections, constraints, and linkages among the components and between the system and its environment are known collectively as the architecture of the system.
### Definition of a System and Key Terms
> - A **system** is a collection of **components** linked together and organised in such away as to be recognisable as a single unit
> - Linked components of a system also define the **boundary** for the system
> - The **environment** is anything outside of the system
> - An **Interface** is a **link** between the **Environment** and the **System**, passing through the **Boundary**
> - 
#### Examples
- Plumbing systems
- Solar systems
- Home Network systems
- Inventory Control systems

### System Decomposition
##### Components
- May be *Irreducible*
- May be *Subsystems*
##### Decomposition
- The division of a system into its components and links
- *Hierarchical*

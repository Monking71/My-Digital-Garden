## Von Neumann Machine
Utilises the stored program concept - First published in 1945 by John von Neumann
Completed in 1952, the IAS computer is the prototype for all subsequent general-purpose computers
### Structure
- Main memory - for storing programs alongside data
- An Arithmetic and Logic Unit ([[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Computer Processors/Arithmetic Logic Unit\|ALU]]) - capable of operating on binary data
- A Control Unit - interprets instruction in memory and executes them
- Input and Output - operated by the control unit
#### Design

## The Bus
### DEC PDP-8
*1964*
The DEC PDP-8 was the first minicomputer
- Didn't require an air-conditioned room
- Could sit on a lab bench / desk
- Cost only ~\$16,000
The DEC was the first commercial device to use a bus structure instead of switches

## *Gordon* Moore's Law
>1965: Every year the number of transistors on a chip would double every year
>1975: Every *other* year the number of...
>>In reality, it has been every 18 months

- The cost of a chip has remained relatively stable throughout the years
- Higher packing density means shorter electrical paths, giving higher performance
- Smaller size gives increased flexibility
- Power and cooling requirements are reduced
- Fewer interconnections reduces points of failure - improving reliability
#### Performance
- Processor speed is increasing
- Memory Capacity is increasing
- Memory speed **lags behind** processor speed
##### Performance Measures
- Various measures are used to assess performance - e.g. memory bandwidth, MIPS. MFLOPS
- The maximum possible will be the value advertised
- Speed often competes with size (or memory) and both must be balanced against cost
- Software availability, ease of maintenance, etc. are also important

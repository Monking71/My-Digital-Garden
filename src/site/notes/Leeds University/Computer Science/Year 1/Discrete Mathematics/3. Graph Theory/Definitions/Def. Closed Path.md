A *closed [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|path]]* is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|path]] that begins and ends at the same vertex. We say that a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|path]] or a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycle]] is *even* or *odd* depending on the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/Proof Techniques/Definitions/Parity\|Parity]] of its length.

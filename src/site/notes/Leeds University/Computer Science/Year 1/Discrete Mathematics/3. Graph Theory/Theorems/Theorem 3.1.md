If $G$ is a graph with vertices $v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{n}$, then $\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1} d(v_{i})=2|{\color{orange} E}(G)|$
{ #Def}


###### *Proof*
Each loop contributes 2 to the summation. In the summation, each edge ${\color{yellow} e}=uv$ that is not a loop is counted exactly twice, once in $d(u)$ and once in $d(v)$

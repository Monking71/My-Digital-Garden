###### Vertex Degree
The *degree of a vertex $v$* in the graph $G$, denoted by $d_{G}(v)$ or just $d(v)$ (or sometimes $\deg(v)$, as in the book), is the number of edges that are incident to $v$ (with [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Loop\|loops]] counted twice, i.e. each [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Loop\|loop]] on $v$ contributes 2 to $d(v)$)

If $G$ is a graph with vertices $v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{n}$, then $\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1} d(v_{i})=2|{\color{orange} E}(G)|$ 
###### *Proof*
Each loop contributes 2 to the summation. In the summation, each edge ${\color{yellow} e}=uv$ that is not a loop is counted exactly twice, once in $d(u)$ and once in $d(v)$

In any graph, the number of vertices of odd degree is even 
###### *Proof*
Let $x_{1}\dots,x_{n}$ be vertices of graph $G$ with even degree and let $y_{1},\dots,y_{m}$ be vertices of odd degree
Let ${\color{blue} S}=d(x_{1})+\dots+d(x_{n})$
and ${\color{red} T}=d(y_{1})+\dots+d(y_{m})$
By [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Theorems/Theorem 3.1\|Theorem 3.1]], ${\color{blue} S}+{\color{red} T}$ is even
Since ${\color{blue} S}$ is the sum of even numbers, ${\color{blue} S}$ is even
So ${\color{red} T}$ must be even
Since ${\color{red} T}$ is the sum of $m$ odd numbers, $m$ must be even

##### Friendship Puzzle
At any party of two or more people, show that there are always two people with exactly the same number of friends at the party

###### *Proof*
Let ${\color{blue} G}$ be a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Simple Graph\|simple graph]] with vertex [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] ${\color{mauve} V}({\color{blue} G})=\set{v_{1},\dots,v_{n}}$ denoting people at the party
Edges of ${\color{blue} G}$ are defined as follows: $uv\in {\color{orange} E}({\color{blue} G})$ if $u$ and $v$ are friends
For $i=1,\dots,n,d(v_{i})=$ number of friends of $v_{i}$

Consider the following 2 cases

**Case 1**: Everyone at the party has at least one friend at the party
So for every $i=1,\dots,n,1\leq d(v_{i})\leq n-1$
Since $n$ variables $d(v_{1}),\dots,d(v_{n})$ are each assigned one of $n-1$ numbers from the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] $\set{1,\dots,n-1}$, at least two of them must have the same value ([[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/1. Combinatorics/1.4 The Pigeonhole Principle/1.4 The Pigeonhole Principle#^Def2\|Pigeonhole Principle]])

**Case 2**: Someone at the party does not have any friends at the party
For some $i\in\set{1,\dots,n},d(v_{i})=0$
So for every $i=1,\dots,n,0\leq d(v_{i})\leq n-2$
Since $n$ variables $d(v_{1}),\dots,d(v_{n})$ are each assigned one of $n-1$ numbers from the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] $\set{0,\dots,n-2}$, at least two of the must have the same value ([[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/1. Combinatorics/1.4 The Pigeonhole Principle/1.4 The Pigeonhole Principle#^Def2\|Pigeonhole Principle]])

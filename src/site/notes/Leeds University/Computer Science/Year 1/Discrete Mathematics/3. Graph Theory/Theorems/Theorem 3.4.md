For a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Simple Graph\|simple graph]] $G$ with $n$ vertices, $n \geq 1$, the following are equivalent
	1. $G$ is [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Connected Graph\|connected]] and has no [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycles]]
	2. $G$ is [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Connected Graph\|connected]] and has $n-1$ edges
	3. $G$ has $n-1$ edges and no [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycles]]
	4. For every pair $u,v \in {\color{mauve} V}(G)$, $G$ has exactly on [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Simple Path\|simple path]] from $u$ to $v$

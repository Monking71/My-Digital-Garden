Let $v_{0}$ and $v_{n}$ be vertices in a graph $G$. A *path* in $G$ from $v_{0}$ to $v_{n}$ of *length* $n$ is an alternating sequence of $n+1$ vertices and $n$ edges, $v_{0}{\color{yellow} e}_{1}v_{1}{\color{yellow} e}_{2}\dots v_{n-1}{\color{yellow} e}_{n}v_{n}$, in which edge ${\color{yellow} e}_{i}$ is incident on vertices $v_{i-1}$ and $v_{i}$ for every $i=1,\dots,n$

Note that in a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Simple Graph\|simple graph]], to denote a path we just need to list the sequence of vertices since two vertices are connected by only one edge, e.g. $v_{0}v_{1}\dots v_{n}$

Let $u$ and $v$ be vertices of a graph $G$

$(\implies)$ Let $P$ be a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|Def. Path]] from $u$ to $v$. If $P$ has no repeated vertices, then $P$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Simple Path\|simple path]] and we are done. So assume that $P$ has a repeated vertex $w$. Let $P'$ be the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|Def.

So $P'$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|Def. Path]] from $u$ to $v$ whose length is smaller than the length of $P$. If $P'$ has no repeated vertices, then we are done. Otherwise, repeat this procedure.

Let $G$ be a graph. For ${\color{red} M} \subseteq {\color{orange} E}(G)$, $G \backslash {\color{red} M}$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by removing the edges from ${\color{red} M}$. So $G\backslash {\color{red} M} = ({\color{mauve} V}(G),{\color{orange} E}(G)\backslash {\color{red} M})\text{.}$
For ${\color{blue} S}\subseteq {\color{mauve} V}(G)$, $G[{\color{blue} S}]$ denotes the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def.

For ${\color{blue} S}\subseteq {\color{mauve} V}(G)$, $G\backslash {\color{blue} S}$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by removing the vertices from ${\color{blue} S}$ (and therefore we also remove all edges of ${\color{orange} E}(G)$ that are incident to vertex in ${\color{blue} S}$). So $G\backslash {\color{blue} S}=G[{\color{mauve} V}(G)\backslash {\color{blue} S}]$ (i.e. the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def.

Let $G$ be a graph. Relation “is connected to” is an [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.34 (Equivalence Relations)\|equivalence relation]] on ${\color{mauve} V}(G)$.
	- It is [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.37 (Reflexive)\|Reflexive]], since any vertex is trivially connected to itself by a path of length 0
	- It is [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.38.1 (Symmetric)\|Symmetric]], since a path from $u$ to $v$ can be traversed in the opposite direction to give a path from $v$ to $u$
	- It is [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.39 (Transitive)\|Transitive]], since a path from $u$ to $v$ and a path from $v$ to $w$ can be combined to give a path from $u$ to $w$

So there is a partition of ${\color{mauve} V}(G)$ into nonempty [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5.

Induced [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Subgraph\|subgraphs]] $G_{1},\dots,G_{k}$ are called the *components* of $G$.

**Method 2**: A *component* (or *connected component*) of $G$ is a maximal (in terms of the number of vertices and edges) connected [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3.

Euler Cycles\|Euler cycle]] [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Connectives/Biconditional\|if and only if]] it has no vertices of odd degree 
###### *Proof*

$(\implies)$ Suppose that $G$ has a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Euler Cycles\|Euler cycle]] $C$ that begins and ends at vertex $v$. Each time a vertex $u$ occurs as an internal vertex of $C$, two of the edges incident to $u$ are used. Since $C$ contains every edge of $G$, $d(u)$ is even for every $u\neq v$. Since $C$ starts and ends at $v$, $d(v)$ is even.

$(\impliedby)$ Assume that $G$ has no vertices of odd degree

**Claim 1**: For every vertex $v\in {\color{mauve} V}(G)$, $G$ contains a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycle]] that begins and ends at $v$
*Proof*:
Let $v\in V(G)$. Start building a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|path]] from $v$ (i.e. moving from one vertex to another along the edges), without repeating edges. When the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|path]] enters a vertex $u\neq v$ through an edge, it can always leave $u$ through an unused edge, since every vertex has an even degree and an odd number of edges incident to $u$ have been used in reaching $u$. So such a walk terminates when we have reached $v$ again, resulting in a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycle]].

Let $C$ be a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycle]] in $G$ of maximum possible length
**Claim 2**: $C$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Euler Cycles\|Euler cycle]]
*Proof* (by contradiction):
Suppose otherwise, i.e. suppose that ${\color{orange} E}(C)\neq {\color{orange} E}(G)$. Let $G'$ be a subgraph obtained from $G$ by removing the edges in ${\color{orange} E}(C)$. In $G'$ every vertex has even degree. Since $G$ is connected and ${\color{orange} E}(G')\neq \emptyset$, there is at least one edge in ${\color{orange} E}(G')$ that is incident to some vertex $u$ of $C$. By **Claim 1**, $G'$ contains a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycle]] $C'$ that begins and ends at $u$. $C$ and $C'$ can be combined into a single [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycle]] by breaking apart $C$ at $u$ to include $C'$. This contradicts the choice of $C$, and hence the claim.

###### Bipartite Graphs
A *bipartite graph* is a graph $G$ whose vertices can be partitioned into two (possibly empty) [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.5 (Subsets and Supersets)\|subsets]] ${\color{blue} X}$ and ${\color{red} Y}$ (so ${\color{blue} X}\cap {\color{red} Y}=\emptyset$ and ${\color{blue} X}\cup {\color{red} Y}={\color{mauve} V}(G)$) such that each edge of $G$ has one end in ${\color{blue} X}$ and one in ${\color{red} Y}$. $({\color{blue} X},{\color{red} Y})$ is called *bipartition* of $G$

Note that a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Simple Graph\|simple graph]] $G$ on one vertex, say $u$ **is** bipartite since we can let ${\color{blue} X}=\set{u}$ and ${\color{red} Y}=\emptyset$.

Every odd [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Closed Path\|closed path]] contains an odd [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|simple cycle]] 
###### *Proof*
Suppose $C$ is an odd closed path. We prove the result by induction on the length $l$ of $C$.

**Base Case**: If $l=1$, then $C$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Loop\|loop]], which is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|simple cycle]] of length 1

**Induction Step**: Suppose $l>1$ and the claim holds for all odd closed paths of length less than $l$ (this is the induction hypothesis). 
If $C$ has no repeated vertices (other than first $=$ last), then $C$ is an odd [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|simple cycle]]. If vertex $v$ is a repeated vertex in $C$, then we can partition $C$ into two [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Closed Path\|closed paths]] from $v$ to $v$, say $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$. Since $C$ is odd, $C_{1}$ or $C_{2}$ must be odd. 
Without loss of generality, $C_{1}$ is odd.
Since $C_{1}$ is odd, and of length less than the length of $C$, by induction hypothesis, $C_{1}$ contains an odd [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|simple cycle]] and hence so does $C$

**Note** that it is not true that every even closed path contains an even [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|simple cycle]]

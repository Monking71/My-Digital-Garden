A [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycle]] in a graph $G$ that contains all of the edges and all of the vertices of $G$ is called a *Euler [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycle]]* (or a *Euler tour*, and in the book it is a Euler circuit)
A graph is *Eulerian* if it has a Euler [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Cycle\|cycle]]

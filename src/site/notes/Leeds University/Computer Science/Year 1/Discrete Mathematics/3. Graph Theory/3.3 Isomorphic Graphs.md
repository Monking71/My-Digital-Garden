###### Isomorphic Graphs

Graphs $G$ and $H$ look exactly the same with exception that their vertices and edges have different labels. $G$ and $H$ are not identical, but isomorphic.

Let $G$ and $H$ be simple graphs.
$G$ is *isomorphic* to $H$, denoted by $G\cong H$, if there exists a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.30 (Bijective)\|bijection]] $f : {\color{mauve} V}(G)\rightarrow {\color{mauve} V}(H)$ such that $uv\in E(G )$ [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Connectives/Biconditional\|if and only if]] $f(u)f(v)\in E(H)$

**Graph Isomorphism Problem**: Determine in polynomial time whether two graphs are isomorphic. (This is a very difficult problem that is still unsolved)

An unlabelled graph can be though of as a representative of an equivalence class of isomorphic graphs. We assign label to vertices and edges in a graph for the purpose of referring to them.

Let $G$ be a graph and $v$ a vertex of $G$. A *cycle* is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|path]] of non-zero length from $v$ to $v$ with no repeated edges. The *length* of a cycle is the number of edges it contains. A *simple cycle* is a cycle from $v$ to $v$ in which, except for the beginning and ending vertices that are both equal to $v$, there are no repeated vertices

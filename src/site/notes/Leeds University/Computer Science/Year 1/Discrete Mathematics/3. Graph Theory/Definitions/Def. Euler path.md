In a graph $G$ a *Euler [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|path]]* is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Path\|path]] that includes all of the vertices of $G$, traverses every edge of $G$ exactly once, and it begins and ends at distinct(different) vertices.

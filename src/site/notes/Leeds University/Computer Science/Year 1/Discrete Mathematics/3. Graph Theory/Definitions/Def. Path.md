Let $v_{0}$ and $v_{n}$ be vertices in a graph $G$. A *path* in $G$ from $v_{0}$ to $v_{n}$ of *length* $n$ is an alternating sequence of $n+1$ vertices and $n$ edges, $v_{0}{\color{yellow} e}_{1}v_{1}{\color{yellow} e}_{2}\dots v_{n-1}{\color{yellow} e}_{n}v_{n}$, in which edge ${\color{yellow} e}_{i}$ is incident on vertices $v_{i-1}$ and $v_{i}$ for every $i=1,\dots,n$

Note that in a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Def. Simple Graph\|simple graph]], to denote a path we just need to list the sequence of vertices since two vertices are connected by only one edge, e.g. $v_{0}v_{1}\dots v_{n}$

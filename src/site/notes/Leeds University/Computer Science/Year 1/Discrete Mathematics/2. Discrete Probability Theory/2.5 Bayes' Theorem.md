###### Bayes' Theorem

We can find the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/2. Discrete Probability Theory/2.3 Conditional Probability\|conditional probability]] that an [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/2. Discrete Probability Theory/Definitions/Event\|Event]] ${\color{red} F}$ occurs, given that [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/2. Discrete Probability Theory/Definitions/Event\|Event]] ${\color{orange} E}$ has occurred, when we know $P({\color{orange} E}|{\color{red} F})$, $P({\color{orange} E}|\overline{{\color{red} F}})$ and $P({\color{red} F})$

>[!example] 
>Suppose that one person in 100,000 has a particular rare disease for which there is a fairly accurate diagnostic test. This test is correct 99% of the time when given to a person selected at random that has the disease; it is correct 99.5% of the time when given to a person selected at random who does not have the disease. Given this information can we find
>1. The probability that a person who tests positive for the disease has the disease?
>2. The probability that a person who tests negative for the disease does not have the disease?

>Should a person who tests positive be very concerned that they have the disease?

${\color{red} F}=$ The [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/2. Discrete Probability Theory/Definitions/Event\|Event]] that a person selected at random has the disease
${\color{orange} E}=$ The [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/2. Discrete Probability Theory/Definitions/Event\|Event]] that a person selected at random tests positive for the disease

1. We want $P({\color{red} F}|{\color{orange} E})$ (The probability that a person who tests positive for the disease actually has the disease)

$P({\color{orange} E}|{\color{red} F})=99\%\rightarrow$ That a diseased person tests positive
$P({\color{orange} E}|\overline{{\color{red} F}})=0.5\%\rightarrow$ That a healthy person tests positive
$P({\color{red} F})=\frac{1}{100,000}\rightarrow$ That a person is diseased

By [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/2. Discrete Probability Theory/Theorems/Theorem 2.4\|Bayes' Theorem]], $\displaystyle P({\color{red} F}|{\color{orange} E})=\frac{P({\color{orange} E}|{\color{red} F})P({\color{red} F})}{P({\color{orange} E}|{\color{red} F})P({\color{red} F})+P({\color{orange} E}|\overline{{\color{red} F}})P(\overline{{\color{red} F}})}$

$\displaystyle \therefore P({\color{red} F}|{\color{orange} E})=\frac{0.99\times0.00001}{0.99(0.00001)+0.005(1-0.00001)}\approx0.002$

2. We want $P(\overline{{\color{red} F}}|\overline{{\color{orange} E}})$ (The probability that a person is healthy given they tested negative)

$P(\overline{{\color{orange} E}}|\overline{{\color{red} F}})=99.5\%\rightarrow$ That a healthy person tests negative
$P(\overline{{\color{orange} E}}|{\color{red} F})=1\%\rightarrow$ That a diseased person tests negative
$P(\overline{{\color{red} F}})=1-\frac{1}{100,000}\rightarrow$ That a person is healthy


By [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/2. Discrete Probability Theory/Theorems/Theorem 2.4\|Bayes' Theorem]], $\displaystyle P(\overline{{\color{red} F}}|\overline{{\color{orange} E}})=\frac{P(\overline{{\color{orange} E}}|\overline{{\color{red} F}})P(\overline{{\color{red} F}})}{P(\overline{{\color{orange} E}}|\overline{{\color{red} F}})P(\overline{{\color{red} F}})+P(\overline{{\color{orange} E}}|{\color{red} F})P({\color{red} F})}$

$\displaystyle \therefore P(\overline{{\color{red} F}}|\overline{{\color{orange} E}})=\frac{0.995(1-0.00001)}{0.995(1-0.00001)+0.01(0.00001)}\approx0.9999999$

By part 1., only 0.2% of people who test positive actually have the disease. Because the disease is extremely rare, the number of people of false positives is far greater than the number of true positive, making the percentage of people who test positive and actually have the disease extremely small. People who test positive should not be overly concerned that they actually have the disease.

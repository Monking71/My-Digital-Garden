For positive integers ${\color{blue} k}$ and ${\color{red} n}$, the number of ${\color{blue} k}$-*permutations* with *unlimited repetition* of a set of ${\color{red} n}$ objects is ${\color{red} n}^{\color{blue} k}$
{ #Definition}

###### *Proof*
Consider the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Year 1/Discrete Mathematics/1. Combinatorics/1.1 Basic Counting Principles/The Multiplication Principle\|Multiplication Principle]]:
If there is unlimited repetition, then for any ${\color{blue} i}_{m}$ there are ${\color{red} n}$ possible outcomes
$\therefore$ The number of ${\color{blue} k}$-*permutations* with *unlimited repetition* is ${\color{red} n}^{\color{blue} k}$

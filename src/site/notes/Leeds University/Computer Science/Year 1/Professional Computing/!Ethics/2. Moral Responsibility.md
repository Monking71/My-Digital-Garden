### Case Study THERAC-25
The Therac-25 was an X-ray system. Between 1985 and 1987 it caused 3 deaths and several injuries due to radiation burns. Unlike previous models, this used a software based safety mechanism.
The problems:
- The system was inadequately safety tested
	- The original analysis exaggerated the safety
- The error messages were repeats of common error messages from previous systems, which were not as urgent and therefore ignored
- Some X-ray technicians ignored the complaints of patients, trusting the machine.

### Responsibility in Computing
It is hard to assign responsibility in cases involving computers due to;
1. Many ‘hands’ being involved
2. The concept of bugs
3. Blaming the computer
4. Ownership without liability
5. Seeing technology as ethically neutral

Nissenbaum and Gotterbarn advocate for a more *positive* notion of responsibility and *accountability*
- a.k.a. finding who isn’t responsible :/

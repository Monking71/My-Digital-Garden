### Types of Hackers
Hackers;
	- People who gain access to computer systems in order to access information or perform other activities; often, but not necessarily, illegally
##### White Hat
- Typically both *ethically* and *legally* legitimate
- They access systems with consent to identify flaws in security, then report them to the company
##### Black Hat
- Typically access computers *without* consent
- Manipulate flaws in security for their own gain
##### Grey Hat
- Morally “grey”
- They might, for instance, hack into a system without consent, but then reveal the security flaws to the company afterwards
### Ethics and Laws
**Legal**
- White hat
**Illegal**
- Black hat
- Grey hat
### Hacking and Property
#### Reasons Against Hacking
- Hacking can threaten **privacy**; it exposes private data and information to the hacker and anyone that the hacker transfers this to
- Hacking can infringe **property**; it accesses another person’s property and may “steal” it
- Hack can occur without the **consent** of the person whose property is targeted
#### Property
Differences between real-world and online theft:
- When you steal information online, the owner of the information still has it, they are not deprived of anything
- Information can be copied without ‘cost’
Similarities between real-world and online theft
- Theft of information often involves an invasion of privacy or a virtual “breaking and entering” to be accessed
- If what is stolen is your *intellectual* property (e.g. a film you made), it may not be as valuable once duplicated/stolen
#### Consent
Consent is vital to the permissibly of many acts
- It is sometimes called “moral magic” because it can turn wrongful acts into permissible acts
- We can think of it as *giving* permission
### TinKode
- **TinKode is** a Romanian hacker who illegally accessed numerous computer systems, including government and military websites
- **TinKode** would publish screenshots and passwords to embarrass the owners
- **TinKode** wanted to embarrass organisations into improving their internet security, and gain some notoriety. He did not seek financial or personal gain
- **TinKode** compared his activities to a free security audit:
	- “I don’t do bad things. I only find and make public the info. Afterwards I send an email to them to fix the holes. It’s like a security audit, but for free”
- **TinKode’s** activities were found to be illegal
- Once his identity was uncovered in 2012, the Romanian hacker received a two year prison sentence and a €93,000 fine

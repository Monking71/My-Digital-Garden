#### Notation
$\color{red} x \in A$ denotes that **x is an element** of the set A.
$\color{red} x \notin A$ denotes that **x is not an element** of the set A.
#### Defining Sets
##### By Enumeration
$$
\color{lightgreen}A\coloneqq\set{0,1,2,3,4,5}=\set{0,1,2,\bullet\bullet\bullet,5}
$$
This is called the **roster method** ( or **extensional** set notation )
##### By characteristic properties
$$
\begin{align}
\color{lightgreen}B\coloneqq\set{x\ |\ x\in A\ and\ x\ is\ even}^{1}
\end{align}
$$
### Fundamentals
- <span style="color:#ff0000">All elements in a set are distinct.</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">The elements of a set do not come with a fixed ordering.</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">The same set can be described in different ways.</span>

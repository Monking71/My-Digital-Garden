The $\color{red}\textrm{existential quantification}$ of $P(x)$ is the statement
$$
\color{red}
\textquoteleft\textrm{There exists an element }x\textrm{ in the domain such that }P(x)\textquoteright
$$
- The notation $\color{red}\exists x\ P(x)$ denotes the existential quantification of $P(x)$
- The symbol $\color{red}\exists$ is called the $\color{red} \textrm{existential quantifier}$
- We read $\exists x\ P(x)$ as $\color{red} \textquoteleft \textrm{there exists an }x\ P(x)\textquoteright$ or $\color{red} \textquoteleft \textrm{there is an }x\ P(x) \textquoteright$

The existential quantification $\exists x\ P(x)$ can be expressed as
- 'There is an $x$ such that $P(x)$'
- 'There is at least one $x$ such that $P(x)$'
- 'For some $x$ $P(x)$'

#### Remarks
- A domain must always be specified when a statement $\exists x\ P(x)$ is used
- The meaning of $\exists x\ P(x)$ changes when the domain changes
- Without specifying the domain, the statement $\exists x\ P(x)$ has no meaning

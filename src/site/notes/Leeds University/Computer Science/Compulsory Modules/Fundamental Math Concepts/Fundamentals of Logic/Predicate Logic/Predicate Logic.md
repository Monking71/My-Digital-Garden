Predicates are statements involving variables, such as
$$
\begin{align}
\color{lightgreen}
x\ &\color{lightgreen}>3, \\
\color{lightgreen}
x\ &\color{lightgreen}=y+3, \\
\color{lightgreen}
z\ &\color{lightgreen}=x+y
\end{align}
$$
$$
\textrm{and}
$$
$$
\color{lightgreen}\textrm{Computer }x\textrm{ is under attack by an intruder}
$$
$$
\textrm{and}
$$
$$
\color{lightgreen}\textrm{Computer }x\textrm{ is functioning properly}
$$
are often found in mathematical assertions, in computer programs, and in system specifications.

These statements are neither true nor false when the values of the variables are not specified

### Predicate and [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Propositional Logic\|Propositional]] Functions
The statement $\textquoteleft\color{red}x\color{lightgreen}\textrm{ is greater than 3}\color{white}\textquoteright$ has two parts
$\color{red}\boxed{O}$ = The variable $\color{red}x$, is the ***subject*** of the statement
$\color{lightgreen}\boxed{O}$ = The ***predicate*** $\color{lightgreen}\textquoteleft\textrm{is greater than 3}\textquoteright$, refers to *a property that the subject of the statement **may or may not have***

We can denote the statement $\textquoteleft\color{red}x\color{lightgreen}\textrm{ is greater than 3}\color{white}\textquoteright$ by $\color{red}P(x)$, where *P* denotes the predicate 'is greater than 3' and $x$ is the variable

The statement *$P(x)$* is also said to be the value of the $\color{red}\textrm{propositional function}$ *$P$* and $x$

Once a value has been assigned to the variable $x$, the statement $P(x)$ becomes a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Propositional Logic\|proposition]] and has a truth value

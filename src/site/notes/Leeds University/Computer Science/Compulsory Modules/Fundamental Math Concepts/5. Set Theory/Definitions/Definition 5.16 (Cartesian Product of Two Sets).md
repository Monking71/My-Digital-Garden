The $\color{red}\text{Cartesian Product}$ of two [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|sets]] $A$, $B$, denoted by $\color{red} A \times B$, is the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] of ordered pairs $(a, b)$, where $a$ belongs to $A$ and $b$ belongs to $B$
$$
\color{red}
A \times B \coloneqq \set{(a,b)\ |\ a \in A\ and\ b \in B}

Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|5.1 Sets]]. A $\color{red}\text{function }f\text{ from }A\text{ to }B$ is an assignment of **exactly** one element of $B$ to each element of $A$

We write $f(A)=b$ if $b$ is the unique element of $B$ assigned by the function $f$ to the element $a$ of $A$

If $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$, we write $\color{red} f : A \to B$

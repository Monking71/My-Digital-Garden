A set is called $\color{red}\text{finite}$, if it contains only finitely many elements, i.e. there is a number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where the set contains exactly $n$ elements

The $\color{red}\text{cardinality}$ of a set $M$ is
$$
|M| \coloneqq \cases{\text{The number of elements in M, if M is finite} \\ \infty\text{, otherwise}}
$$

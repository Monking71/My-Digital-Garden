Let $U$ be a fixed universe, that is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] itself, and let $A$, $B \subseteq U$ be [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|5.1 Sets]].
Then:
1. ![[Double Complement\|Double Complement]]

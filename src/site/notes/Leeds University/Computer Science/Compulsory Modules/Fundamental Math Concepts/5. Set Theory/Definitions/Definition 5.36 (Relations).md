Let $A$ be a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]]. A $\color{red}\text{relation on the set }A$ is a relation from $A$ to itself.

>[!example] 
>Let $A \coloneqq \set{1,2,3,4}$
>*Which pairs are in the relation $R$ on $A$, given by $R \coloneqq \set{(a, b)\ |\ a \text{ divides } b}$?*
>
>The relation $R$ can be represented both $\color{red}\text{graphically}$ and by an $\color{red}\text{adjacency matrix}$

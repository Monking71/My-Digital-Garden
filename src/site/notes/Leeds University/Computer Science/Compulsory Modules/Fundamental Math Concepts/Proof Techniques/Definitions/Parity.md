The integer $n$ is $\color{red}\textrm{even}$ if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n=2k$, and $n$ is $\color{red}\textrm{odd}$ if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n=2k+1$

Two integers have the $\color{red}\textrm{same parity}$ when **both are even** or **both are odd**
they have $\color{red}\textrm{opposite parity}$ when one is even and the other is odd

$\color{lightgreen}\textrm{Note that every integer is either odd or even, but not both}$

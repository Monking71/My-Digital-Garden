A $\color{red}\textrm{theorem}$ is a statement that can be shown to be true.

A theorem consists of assumptions ( premises ) and a conclusion
Assumptions and the conclusion are statement such that the following is true:
$$
\color{red}\textrm{If all assumptions are satisfied, then the conclusion must be true}
$$
The $\color{red}\textrm{proof}$ of a theorem has to establish that the statement of the theorem is true.
The proof can use
- The assumptions of the theorem
- Definitions, known facts and known theorems
- Statements, that are proved within the proof or have already been proved elsewhere
- Logical rules of inference
##### Minor Terminology
- Theorems are statements that are considered very important
- Less import theorems are sometimes called [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Propositional Logic\|propositions]]
	- A less important theorem that is helpful in the proof of other results is often called a $\color{red}\textrm{lemma}$
{ #lemma}

- A $\color{red}\textrm{corollary}$ is a theorem that follows immediately from a theorem or a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Propositional Logic\|proposition]] that has been proved
{ #corollary}

- A $\color{red}\textrm{conjecture}$ is a statement that is being proposed to be true statement, usually on the basis of some partial evidence, but a proof is still missing
{ #conjecture}

The $\color{red}\text{Cartesian Product}$ of the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Set Theory/Sets\|sets]] $A_{1},A_{2}\dots ,A_{n}$ is denoted by
$A_{1} \times A_{2} \times \dots \times A_{n}$
and is the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Set Theory/Sets\|set]] of ordered $n$-[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.14 (Pairs and Tuples)\|tuples]] $(a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n})$, where $a_{i}$ belongs to $A_{i}$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n$
$$

A_{1} \times A_{2} \times \dots \times A_{n} \coloneqq \set{(a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n})\ |\ a_{1} \in A_{1},\dots,a_{n} \in A_{n}}

A [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]] $f : A \to B$ is said to be $\color{red}\text{surjective}$ (or $\color{red}\text{onto}$), [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Connectives/Biconditional\|if and only if]] for every element $b \in B$ there is an element $a \in A$ with $f(a) = b$
	- It can also be said that the *[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.27.3 (Range)\|Range]]* = *[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.27.1 (Domain, Codomain)\|Codomain]]*

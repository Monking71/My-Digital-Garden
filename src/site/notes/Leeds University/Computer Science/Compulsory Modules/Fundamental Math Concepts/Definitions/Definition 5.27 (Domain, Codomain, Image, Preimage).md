Let $f : A \to B$ be a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]]

Then the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Set Theory/Sets\|set]] $A$ is called the $\color{red}\text{domain}$ of the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]] $f$, and the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Set Theory/Sets\|set]] $B$ is called the $\color{red}\text{codomain}$ of the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]] $f$

If $f(a)=b$, we say that $b$ is the $\color{red}\text{image}$ of $a$, and $a$ is the $\color{red}\text{preimage}$ of $b$

The $\color{red}\text{range}$ (also called $\color{red}\text{image}$) of $f$ is the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Set Theory/Sets\|set]] of all images of elements of $A$

Also if $f$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]] from $A$ to $B$, we say the $f$ $\color{red}\text{maps}$ $A$ to $B$

When specifying a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]], you $\color{red}\text{always}$ need to say
1. Which [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Set Theory/Sets\|set]] you choose as the $\color{red}\text{domain}$,
2. Which [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Set Theory/Sets\|set]] you choose as the $\color{red}\text{codomain}$, and
3. $\color{red}\text{For each memeber of the domain}$ you have to say $\color{red}\text{which member of the codomain it is mapped to}$
>[!important] 
>Note that if you change the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Set Theory/Sets\|domain]] or the codomain, you have a different [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]].
>If you change the mapping of the elements, you also have a different [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Definitions/Definition 5.26 (Function)\|function]].

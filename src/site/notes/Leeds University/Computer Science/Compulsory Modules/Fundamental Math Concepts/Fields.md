>A $\color{red}\text{field}$ is a group under both addition and multiplication 

A $\color{red}\text{field}$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] $F$ together with two binary operations $+$ and $\bullet$ of $F$ with the following properties
**Associativity** of addition and multiplication:
$a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$ and $a\times(b\times c)=(a\times b)\times c$
**Commutativity** of addition and multiplication: $a+b=b+a$ and $a\times b=b\times a$
**Additive and Multiplicative Identity**: There exists two different elements $0$ and $1$ in $F$ such that
$a+0=a$ and $a\times 1 = a$

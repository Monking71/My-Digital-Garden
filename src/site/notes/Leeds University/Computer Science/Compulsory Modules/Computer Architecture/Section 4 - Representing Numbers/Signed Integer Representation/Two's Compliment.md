Basically, the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Definitions/Most Significant Bit\|MSB]] is negative
For example,
$$
\begin{align}
-7 &= -8+0+0+1 \\&= 1001 \\
or\ in\ 8\ bits: \\
-7 &= -128+64+32+16+8+0+0+1 \\&= 1111\ 1001
\end{align}
$$
-5 = -16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1
= 1 1011

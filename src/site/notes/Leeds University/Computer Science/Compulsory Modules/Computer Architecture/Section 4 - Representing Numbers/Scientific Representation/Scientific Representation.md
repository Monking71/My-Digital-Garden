\begin{align}
\color{red}+\color{yellow}1\color{orange}.01001
\color{white}\times\color{lavender}10^{\color{blueviolet}-\color{blue}101}
\end{align}
$$
$\color{red}\boxed{O}$ = Sign of the ***Mantissa***
$\color{yellow}\boxed{O}$ = The ***[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Definitions/Most Significant Bit\|MSB]]***
$\color{yellow}\boxed{O}\color{white}+\color{orange}\boxed{O}$ = The ***Mantissa***
$\color{lavender}\boxed{O}$ = The *number base* 
$\color{blueviolet}\boxed{O}$ = Sign of the ***Exponent***
$\color{blue}\boxed{O}$ = The ***Exponent***
The decimal point ( or other base ) is called the ***Radix Point***

Where the ***[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Definitions/Most Significant Bit\|MSB]]*** is always a 1
This can be done by simply moving the ***radix point*** until there is a 1 in the ***[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Definitions/Most Significant Bit\|MSB]]***

The advantage of normalisation is that the ***[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Definitions/Most Significant Bit\|MSB]]*** doesn't need to be stored as it will always be a 1

All [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 4 - Representing Numbers/Floating Point\|Floating Point]] numbers are *usually* normalised

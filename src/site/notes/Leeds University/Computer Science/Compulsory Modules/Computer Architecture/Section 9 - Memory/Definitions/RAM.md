**RAM** ( [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Random Access\|Random Access]] Memory ) is actually misnamed since [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Semiconductor Memory\|semiconductor memory]] is always [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Random Access\|random access]]
- It is really read/write memory
- It is volatile and so only useful for temporary storage
- It can be static ( SRAM ) or dynamic ( [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Dynamic RAM\|DRAM]] )

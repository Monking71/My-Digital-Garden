- Between 2 strings of bits
	- The number of bit positions in which 2 strings differ
	- E.g. the distance between $1011101 \rightarrow 1001001$
		- is 2 as $10\color{red}0\color{white}1\color{red}0\color{white}01$
- Minimum Hamming Distance of a code
	- If distance is $d$, then $d\textendash \textrm{single}$ bit errors are required to convert any one valid code ( string ) into another code with the same checksum

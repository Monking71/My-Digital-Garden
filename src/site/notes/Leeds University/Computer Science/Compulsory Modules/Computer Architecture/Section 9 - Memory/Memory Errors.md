Memory is subject to errors
- Those caused by permanent physical defects are known as **hard failures**
- **Soft errors** and random events which alter the stored information but cause no permanent damage
Errors can be detected and corrected at the expense of storing additional bits and a little work,
e.g. **[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Parity Bit\|parity bits]]**, **[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Hamming Distance\|Hamming codes]]**

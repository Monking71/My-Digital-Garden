The design of a computer's memory is constrained by **[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Memory Capacity\|capacity]]**, **[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Transfer Rate\|transfer rate]]** and **cost**
In general:
- Faster [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Access Time\|access time]] requires ***greater*** cost per bit
- Greater capacity implies ***smaller*** cost per bit
- Greater capacity implies ***slower*** [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Access Time\|access time]]
### Physical Memory
##### Common Characteristics
- Memory which needs a continuous power supply to preserve values is **volatile**
- On **non-volatile** memory, data remains stored even if it is powered-off
	- Also known as **persistent memory**
	- *[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/ROM\|ROM]]* ( [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/ROM\|Read Only Memory]] ) is an example of non-volatile memory
##### Physical Types
- **[[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Semiconductor Memory\|Semiconductor]] Storage** - used in [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/RAM\|RAM]], USB sticks
- **Magnetic Storage** - used in disks and tapes
- **Optical Storage** - used in CDs and DVDs
#### Types of [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/RAM\|RAM]]
- [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Dynamic RAM\|DRAM]] is simpler and smaller, so it provides denser storage and is cheaper
	- It is favoured for large memory requirements
	  **e.g.** main memory
- [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Static RAM\|SRAM]] is faster but takes more space
	- It is favoured for cache memory and CPU registers
	- Users typically cannot replace [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Computer Architecture/Section 9 - Memory/Definitions/Static RAM\|SRAM]]

### Client-Server Architecture
A program on a **Client Computer** requests services from a program on a (shared) **Server Computer**
#### Advantages of Centralisation
- Easier administration of services by IT professionals
- Easier availability and location by users
- Consistency of resources, such as files and data, can be managed and assured
- More efficient and cost-effective hardware procurement through purchasing a small number of more powerful computers
### Peer-to-Peer Computing
Computers on a network are treated as equals
Each computer can share resources with the other computers on the network
#### Problems
- Difficult to establish centralised control of services
- Difficult to locate services
- Difficult to synchronise versions of files or software
- Difficult to secure network from unauthorised access and from viruses

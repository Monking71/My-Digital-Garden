Let $\color{lightgreen} S$ be a finite non-empty sample space, say $\color{red} S=\set{a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}}$
A *finite *probability space* or *probability model*, is obtained by assigning to each element $\color{lightgreen} a_{i}$ in $\color{red} S$ is a real number $\color{lightgreen} p_{i}$, called the *probability* of $\color{lightgreen} a_{i}$, satisfying:
1. Each $\color{lightgreen} p_{i}$ is non-negative, i.e. $\color{lightgreen} p_{i}\geq0$
2. The sum of $\color{lightgreen} p_{i}$â€™s is 1, i.e. $\color{lightgreen} p_{1}+p_{2}+\dots+p_{n}=1$

The *probability* of an event $\color{lightgreen} A$, written $\color{lightgreen} P(A)$, is the sum of the probabilities of the elements in $\color{lightgreen} A$
The singleton set $\color{lightgreen} \set{a_{1}}$ is called an *elementary event*, and for rotational convenience we write $\color{blue} P(a_{i})$ for $\color{blue} P(\set{a_{i}})$

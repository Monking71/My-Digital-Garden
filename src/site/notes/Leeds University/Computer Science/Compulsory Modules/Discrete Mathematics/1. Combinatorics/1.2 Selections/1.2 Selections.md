Suppose that a child is offered a bag containing three types of sweets, aniseed drops $({\color{red} A})$, butter mints $({\color{lightgreen} B})$ and cherry drops $({\color{blue} C})$. In how many ways can the child ***select*** two sweets?

This problem is not defined well, since we are not told:
- whether or not the same type of sweet can be selected twice, i.e. is ${\color{red} AA}$ allowed?
- whether the order matter, i.e. is ${\color{red} A}{\color{lightgreen} B}$ to be treated the same as ${\color{lightgreen} B}{\color{red} A}$, or not?

There are 4 cases to consider:
1. **Repeats are allowed** and **order matters**. This gives 9 possibilities:
	- ${\color{red} A}{\color{red} A}, {\color{red} A}{\color{lightgreen} B}, {\color{red} A}{\color{blue} C}, {\color{lightgreen} B}{\color{red} A}, {\color{lightgreen} B}{\color{lightgreen} B}, {\color{lightgreen} B}{\color{blue} C}, {\color{blue} C}{\color{red} A}, {\color{blue} C}{\color{lightgreen} B}, {\color{blue} C}{\color{blue} C}$

1. **Repeats are allowed** and **order *doesn’t* matter**. This gives 6 possibilities:
	- ${\color{red} A}{\color{red} A}, {\color{red} A}{\color{lightgreen} B}, {\color{red} A}{\color{blue} C}, {\color{lightgreen} B}{\color{lightgreen} B}, {\color{lightgreen} B}{\color{blue} C}, {\color{blue} C}{\color{blue} C}$

1. **Repeats are *not* allowed** and **order matters**. This gives 6 possibilities
	- ${\color{red} A}{\color{lightgreen} B}, {\color{red} A}{\color{blue} C}, {\color{lightgreen} B}{\color{red} A}, {\color{lightgreen} B}{\color{blue} C}, {\color{blue} C}{\color{red} A}, {\color{blue} C}{\color{lightgreen} B}$

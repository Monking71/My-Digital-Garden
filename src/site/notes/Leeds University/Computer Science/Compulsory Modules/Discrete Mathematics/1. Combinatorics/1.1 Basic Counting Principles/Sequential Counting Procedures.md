A *sequential counting procedure* is one that satisfies the following three properties:
1. The steps are ***ordered***, i.e. any two sequences of different outcomes represent distinguishable composite outcomes
2. The steps are ***independent***, i.e. the number of outcomes of one step is not affected by the outcomes of the preceding steps
3. The steps are ***complete***, i.e. each composite outcome consists of a complete sequence of individual outcomes, one for each step

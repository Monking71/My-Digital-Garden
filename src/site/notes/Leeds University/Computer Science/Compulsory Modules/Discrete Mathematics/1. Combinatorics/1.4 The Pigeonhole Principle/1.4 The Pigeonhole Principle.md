The ***Pigeonhole Principle***  (or the *Dirichlet Principle*) is sometimes useful in answering the question:
<u>Is there an item having a given property?</u>

**Pigeonhole Principle**: If ${\color{red} n}$ pigeons fly into ${\color{blue} k}$ pigeonholes and ${\color{blue} k}\le {\color{red} n}$, then some pigeonhole contains *at least* two pigeons

**Example**:
>[!example] 
>Ten people have the first name Alice, Bernard and Charles, and last names Lee, Mc-Duff and Ng. Show that at least two people have the same first and last names.

There are $3\times3=9$ possible names for the 10 people. If we think of people as *pigeons* and the names as *pigeonholes*, we can consider the assignments of names to people as assigning pigeonholes to pigeons. By the **Pigeonhole Principle**, some name (pigeonhole) is assigned to at least two people (pigeons)

**Generalised Pigeonhole Principle**: If ${\color{red} n}$ pigeons fly into ${\color{blue} k}$ pigeonholes, then some pigeonhole contains *at least* $\empheqlceil\frac{{\color{red} n}}{{\color{blue} k}}\empheqrceil$ pigeons
{ #Definition}


###### *Proof*:
Suppose that none of the pigeonholes contain more than $\empheqlceil\frac{{\color{red} n}}{{\color{blue} k}}\empheqrceil - 1$ pigeons. Then the total number of pigeons is at most ${\color{blue} k}(\empheqlceil\frac{{\color{red} n}}{{\color{blue} k}}\empheqrceil - 1)$, which is **always** less than ${\color{red} n}$

>[!example] 
>What is the minimum number of students required in a discrete maths class to be sure that at least 6 will receive the same grade, if there are 5 possible grades, A,B,C,D and F

$\empheqlceil\frac{{\color{red} n}}{{\color{blue} 5}}\empheqrceil=6$
${\color{red} n}=5(6-1)+1=25+1=26$

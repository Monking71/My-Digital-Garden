If a procedure can be broken down into $m$ events or cases whose sets of outcomes are mutually exclusive, with $j_i$ possible outcomes for the first event, $j_2$ possible outcomes for the second event, â€¦, and $j_m$ possible outcomes for the $m^{th}$ event, then the total number of outcomes of the procedure is $j_{1}+j_{2}+j_{3}+\dotsc+j_{m}$.

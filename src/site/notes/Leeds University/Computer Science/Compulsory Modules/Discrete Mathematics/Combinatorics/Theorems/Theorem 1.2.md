*For integers $\color{blue} k$ and $\color{blue} n$ such that $\color{blue} 0 \leq k \leq n$, the total number of $\color{blue} k$-combinations of a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/5.1 Sets\|set]] of $\color{blue} n$ objects is $\color{blue} C(n,k)=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$*

*For integers $\color{blue} k$ and $\color{blue} n$ such that $\color{blue} 0 \leq k \leq n$, the number of $\color{blue} k$-permutations of a set of $\color{blue} n$ objects is $\color{blue} P(n,k)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$*

>[!example] 
>*How many 7 letter strings with no repeated letters can be formed from the English alphabet?*
>
>$\color{blue} n = 26 \coloneqq \text{The number of letters in the alphabet}$
>$\color{blue} k = 7$
>$\color{blue} \therefore$
>$\color{blue} P(26,7) = \frac{26!}{19!}$

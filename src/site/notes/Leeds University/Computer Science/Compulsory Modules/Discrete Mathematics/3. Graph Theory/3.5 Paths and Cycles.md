Let $v_{0}$ and $v_{n}$ be vertices in a graph $G$. A *path* in $G$ from $v_{0}$ to $v_{n}$ of *length* $n$ is an alternating sequence of $n+1$ vertices and $n$ edges, $v_{0}{\color{yellow} e}_{1}v_{1}{\color{yellow} e}_{2}\dots v_{n-1}{\color{yellow} e}_{n}v_{n}$, in which edge ${\color{yellow} e}_{i}$ is incident on vertices $v_{i-1}$ and $v_{i}$ for every $i=1,\dots,n$

Note that in a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Graph\|simple graph]], to denote a path we just need to list the sequence of vertices since two vertices are connected by only one edge, e.g. $v_{0}v_{1}\dots v_{n}$

A *simple path* from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ in a graph $G$ is a path from $u$ to $v$ with no repeated vertices

Let $G$ be a graph, and $u$ and $v$ two vertices of $G$. There is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$ in $G$ [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Connectives/Biconditional\|if and only if]] there is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Path\|simple path]] from $u$ to $v$ in $G$ 
###### *Proof*
Let $u$ and $v$ be vertices of a graph $G$

$(\impliedby)$ A [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Path\|simple path]] from $u$ to $v$ in $G$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$, so the result trivially holds

$(\implies)$ Let $P$ be a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$. If $P$ has no repeated vertices, then $P$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Path\|simple path]] and we are done. So assume that $P$ has a repeated vertex $w$. Let $P'$ be the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] obtained by going along $P$ from $u$ to the first appearance of $w$, and then going along $P$ from the last appearance of $w$ to $v$. So $P'$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$ whose length is smaller than the length of $P$. If $P'$ has no repeated vertices, then we are done. Otherwise, repeat this procedure. By repeating this procedure until there are no more repeated vertices, we end up with a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Path\|simple path]] from $u$ to $v$

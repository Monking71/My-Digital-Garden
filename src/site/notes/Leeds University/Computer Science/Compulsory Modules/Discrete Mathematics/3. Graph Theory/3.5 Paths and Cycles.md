Let $v_{0}$ and $v_{n}$ be vertices in a graph $G$. A *path* in $G$ from $v_{0}$ to $v_{n}$ of *length* $n$ is an alternating sequence of $n+1$ vertices and $n$ edges, $v_{0}{\color{yellow} e}_{1}v_{1}{\color{yellow} e}_{2}\dots v_{n-1}{\color{yellow} e}_{n}v_{n}$, in which edge ${\color{yellow} e}_{i}$ is incident on vertices $v_{i-1}$ and $v_{i}$ for every $i=1,\dots,n$

Note that in a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Graph\|simple graph]], to denote a path we just need to list the sequence of vertices since two vertices are connected by only one edge, e.g. $v_{0}v_{1}\dots v_{n}$

Let $G$ be a graph, and $u$ and $v$ two vertices of $G$. There is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$ in $G$ [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Connectives/Biconditional\|if and only if]] there is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Path\|simple path]] from $u$ to $v$ in $G$ 
###### *Proof*
Let $u$ and $v$ be vertices of a graph $G$

$(\impliedby)$ A [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Path\|simple path]] from $u$ to $v$ in $G$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$, so the result trivially holds

$(\implies)$ Let $P$ be a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$. If $P$ has no repeated vertices, then $P$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Path\|simple path]] and we are done. So assume that $P$ has a repeated vertex $w$. Let $P'$ be the [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] obtained by going along $P$ from $u$ to the first appearance of $w$, and then going along $P$ from the last appearance of $w$ to $v$. So $P'$ is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$ whose length is smaller than the length of $P$. If $P'$ has no repeated vertices, then we are done. Otherwise, repeat this procedure. By repeating this procedure until there are no more repeated vertices, we end up with a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Simple Path\|simple path]] from $u$ to $v$

Two vertices $u$ and $v$ of a graph $G$ are said to be *connected* if there is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$

A graph $G$ is *connected* if for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$ there is a [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Definitions/Path\|path]] from $u$ to $v$.
{ #connected}


Otherwise $G$ is ***dis**connected*

A graph $H$ is a *subgraph* of a graph $G$, denoted by $H \subseteq G$, if ${\color{mauve} V}(H)\subseteq {\color{mauve} V}(G)$ and ${\color{orange} E}(H) \subseteq {\color{orange} E}(G)$. A subgraph $H$ of $G$ is a *proper subgraph* of $G$ if $H\neq G$

A graph $H$ is an *induced subgraph* of a graph $G$, if $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ such that every edge of $G$ with both endnodes in ${\color{mauve} V}(H)$ is also an edge of $H$ (A subgraph but the edges aren’t changed, just less vertices). We say that $H$ is the subgraph of $G$ induced by the node set ${\color{mauve} V}(H)$

![subgraphs.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Discrete%20Mathematics/3.%20Graph%20Theory/images/subgraphs.png)

Let $G$ be a graph. For ${\color{red} M} \subseteq {\color{orange} E}(G)$, $G \backslash {\color{red} M}$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by removing the edges from ${\color{red} M}$. So $G\backslash {\color{red} M} = ({\color{mauve} V}(G),{\color{orange} E}(G)\backslash {\color{red} M})\text{.}$
For ${\color{blue} S}\subseteq {\color{mauve} V}(G)$, $G[{\color{blue} S}]$ denotes the subgraph of $G$ induced by ${\color{blue} S}$.
For ${\color{blue} S}\subseteq {\color{mauve} V}(G)$, $G\backslash {\color{blue} S}$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by removing the vertices from ${\color{blue} S}$ (and therefore we also remove all edges of ${\color{orange} E}(G)$ that are incident to vertex in ${\color{blue} S}$). So $G\backslash {\color{blue} S}=G[{\color{mauve} V}(G)\backslash {\color{blue} S}]$ (i.e. the subgraph induced by $\overline{{\color{blue} S}}$)

Let $G$ be a graph. Relation “is connected to” is an [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.34 (Equivalence Relations)\|equivalence relation]] on ${\color{mauve} V}(G)$.
	- It is [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.37 (Reflexive)\|Reflexive]], since any vertex is trivially connected to itself by a path of length 0
	- It is [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.38.1 (Symmetric)\|Symmetric]], since a path from $u$ to $v$ can be traversed in the opposite direction to give a path from $v$ to $u$
	- It is [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.39 (Transitive)\|Transitive]], since a path from $u$ to $v$ and a path from $v$ to $w$ can be combined to give a path from $u$ to $w$

So there is a partition of ${\color{mauve} V}(G)$ into nonempty [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.5 (Subsets and Supersets)\|subsets]] ${\color{mauve} V}_{1},\dots,{\color{mauve} V}_{k}$ such that $u$ and $v$ are connected [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Connectives/Biconditional\|if and only if]] both $u$ and $v$ belong to the same [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/5. Set Theory/Definitions/Definition 5.5 (Subsets and Supersets)\|subset]] ${\color{mauve} V}_{i}$. For $i=1,\dots,k$ we define $G_{i}$ to be the subgraph of $G$ induced by the node set ${\color{mauve} V}_{i}$. Induced subgraphs $G_{1},\dots,G_{k}$ are called the *components* of $G$. Note that [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/3.5 Paths and Cycles#^connected\|connected graphs]] are those that have only one component.

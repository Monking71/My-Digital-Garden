In any graph, the number of vertices of odd degree is even
{ #Def}


###### *Proof*
Let $x_{1}\dots,x_{n}$ be vertices of graph $G$ with even degree and let $y_{1},\dots,y_{m}$ be vertices of odd degree
Let ${\color{blue} S}=d(x_{1})+\dots+d(x_{n})$
and ${\color{red} T}=d(y_{1})+\dots+d(y_{m})$
By [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/3. Graph Theory/Theorems/Theorem 3.1\|Theorem 3.1]], ${\color{blue} S}+{\color{red} T}$ is even
Since ${\color{blue} S}$ is the sum of even numbers, ${\color{blue} S}$ is even
So ${\color{red} T}$ must be even
Since ${\color{red} T}$ is the sum of $m$ odd numbers, $m$ must be even

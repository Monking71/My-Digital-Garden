*A connected [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Definitions/Undirected Graph\|graph]] with at least one edge has an Euler cycle [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Fundamental Math Concepts/Fundamentals of Logic/Propositional Logic/Connectives/Biconditional\|if and only if]] it has no vertices of odd degree*

###### Proof
Let $\color{lightgreen} G$ be a connected [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Definitions/Undirected Graph\|graph]] with $\geq 1$ edges
$\implies$ Suppose that $\color{red} C$ is an Euler cycle of $\color{lightgreen} G$

###### Finite Probability Spaces
Let ${\color{blue} S}$ be a finite non-empty [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/2. Discrete Probability Theory/Definitions/Sample Space\|sample space]], say ${\color{blue} S}=\set{a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}}$

A *finite probability space* or *probability model*, is obtained by assigning to each element $a_{i}$ in ${\color{blue} S}$ a real number, called the *probability* of $a_{i}$, satisfying:
1. Each $p_{i}$ is non-negative, i.e. $p_{i}\geq0$
2. The sum of $p_{i}$â€™s is 1, i.e. $p_{1}+p_{2}+\dots+p_{n}=1$
The probability of an even ${\color{red} A}$, written $P({\color{red} A})$, is the sum of the probabilities of the elements in ${\color{red} A}$

The singleton set $\set{a_{i}}$ is called an *elementary [[Leeds University/Computer Science/Compulsory Modules/Discrete Mathematics/2. Discrete Probability Theory/Definitions/Event\|event]]*, and for notational convenience we write $P(a_{i})$ for $P(\set{a_{i}})$

${\color{red} A}=\set{1,3,5}$
${\color{orange} B}=\set{2,4,6}$

$P({\color{red} A})=P(1)+P(3)+P(5)=\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8}=\frac{5}{8}$
$P({\color{orange} B})=P(2)+P(4)+P(6)=\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8}=\frac{3}{8}$

>[!Introduction] 
>Introduce the topic of AI in smart homes. Explain why this topic is important and what impact it has on digital society and the digital economy. You can also state the objectives of your report here.

</div></div>


In recent years AI has become much more prevalent in our personal lives. With the invention of tools such as the Google Assistant[^1] and Amazon Alexa[^2] along with the widespread integration of the Internet of Things (IoT)[^3] our houses are becoming more automated by the day.
My objective in this report is to explore how AI is currently used in homes, how effective these AIs are at reducing energy consumption and how comfortable the general public feels about AI managing their homes. I also plan to include any thoughts I have on how the current methods could be improved.

>[!Methods] 
> In this section, you should describe how you conducted your research. Mention the resources you used, such as academic articles, web resources, and any software tools (like ChatGPT). You should also explain your criteria for evaluating the potential impact of AI in home automation on achieving net-zero targets.

</div></div>


My research has been conducted through my own experience with automating my home through AI and the use of a variety of different academic papers.
I've based my criteria for evaluating the potential impact around achieving net-zero targets; such as saving energy and reducing carbon footprint from decreased manual intervention.
Throughout my research and the writing of this report, I have used OpenAI’s Bing Chat Model[^4] to help provide me with academic papers and to help me keep my report in line with the brief. I have *not* used any text or facts produced by Bing Chat, or any other AI, into this report.

A home energy management system (HEMS) is a system that, through the efficient control of home appliances, monitors and reduces energy consumption (Mahapatra and Nayyar, 2022). 
Kwon et al. (2022) proposed an AI-based HEMS (AI-HEMS) that monitors a house and it’s occupants, such as when they leave, when they sleep and which rooms are currently occupied. The AI-HEMS used this data to intelligently control a heater and through a performance analysis, was found to reduce *absolute* energy consumption by 14%, definitely reducing the carbon footprint. Since the test was done without dynamic electricity pricing, assuming the heating bills are calculated in proportion to the energy savings, it can be said that there was also an approximate 14% reduction in heating bills (Kwon et al., 2022).
This shows an apparent improvement over Google Nest, the current state-of-the-art AI-thermostat, which saves an average of 10%–12% on heating bills (Google, n.d.). However, the US does follow dynamic energy pricing so this cannot be equated to energy savings or a reduction in carbon footprint.

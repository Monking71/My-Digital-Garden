Ethical questions are non-empirical
	- Are solved without observation and experimentation
#### What is a profession?
A profession requires 6 things,
1. *Intellectual Basis*, requires a good education
2. *Private Practice*, being a contractor??
3. *Advisory Function*, give advice then act on it if it is accepted - has control over their work (not a ‘slave’)
4. *Tradition of service*, not working purely for money??
5. *Representative Institute*, one or more institutes representing the profession
6. *Code of Conduct*, a code of professional ethics enforced by the institute or institutes

The last thing is must have a protected term such as a ‘Doctor’ or a ‘Chartered IT professional’
##### Codes of Conduct
There are several professional bodies that govern computing such as:
-  The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)
-  The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
-  The British Computing Society (BCS)
All these codes contain some commitment to:
1. Acting in the public interest
2. Avoiding harm to other people

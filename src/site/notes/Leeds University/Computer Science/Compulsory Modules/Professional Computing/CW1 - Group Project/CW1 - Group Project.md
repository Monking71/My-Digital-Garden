You can earn awards for personal records, streaks, and major milestones
You can compete with friends
### History
You can also review individual workouts, finding info such as how long you worked out, average heart rate, total calories burned and more

You can also view more general information such as yearly data about different sports, i.e.
- Running Distance
- Cycling Distance
- Swimming Distance
- Downhill snow sports distance
### Reminders
Help you keep track of your goals
## <span style="color:#ff0000">Apple</span> - Food and Nutrition
Has a nutrition section but it isn't very good, requires exact information to be inputted ( i.e. the milligrams of sodium in a drink )

Instead this section relies on third-party apps to provide information,
such as:
- MyFitnessPal - Ironically
- Lifesum
Which both massive food databases to allow for quick and easy entry of nutritional information

Apple health then displays this information with a breakdown of your macronutrients and micronutrients for the day, month and year
## <span style="color:#ff0000">Apple</span> - Weight Loss
Apples Health's weight loss section is pretty simplistic. Simply weigh yourself regularly and enter the data in, the app will compile this data and show you trends and changes over days, months or years

Can sync with smart scales
## <span style="color:#ff0000">Apple</span> - Body Composition
Similar to weight loss, Apple Health allows you to enter information such as height, body fat percentage, body mass index, lean body mass and waist circumference.

Again, these can be added manually but are intended to be used with smart scales and/or other fitness apps
## <span style="color:#ff0000">Apple</span> - Sleep
Allows you to enter information such as 'bed times' and when you plan to wake up, and then tracks your sleep between those times.
Without a fitness tracker ( apple watch ) it does this by checking whether you've gone on your phone or iPad between those times
With a tracker, it can measure morse useful information such as REM sleep Core sleep and Deep sleep times

Syncs from the Sleep App on Apple Watch or other third-party apps
## <span style="color:#ff0000">Apple</span> - Stress and Mindfulness
Little to no use without a third-party app ( For example, the Mindfulness app on apple watch )

The Mindfulness app gives you breathing instructions to help you relax and can give you reminders
## <span style="color:#ff0000">Apple</span> - Health Records
Allows you to import your health data from a doctor or clinic
- Only two hospitals in the UK support this
- More popular in America
### Medical ID
Allows critical information to be accessed from the home screen ( on an iPhone ) such as medical conditions, allergies and blood type for paramedics to use. Can also show emergency contacts and even whether you are an organ donor
## <span style="color:#ff0000">Apple</span> - Export
Can export your data to a variety of services ( Email, Notes, Google Drive ) for sharing with health professionals.

## <span style="color:#2519d2">MyFitnessPal</span> - Exercise
Similar to Apple Health, MyFitnessPal requires syncing with a fitness tracker to show its full potential
However, unlike Apple, MyFitnessPal does not have its own official fitness tracker like the Apple Watch. Instead it has partnered with many different companies to allow for easy integration

MyFitnessPal also allows you to record gym information such as reps and sets for different workouts, recording your improvements over time.
If you don't have a fitness tracker, the app will use its algorithms to calculate how many calories you burned, and can show this relative to your calorie input

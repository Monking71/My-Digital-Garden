## Charles Babbage ( 1791-1871 )
Babbage is generally regarded as the "Father of Computing"
He designed a mechanical device:
### The Analytical Engine
Charles' work was Government funded
- In 1842, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was told it was "worthless" and he never saw it built
In 1878, the British Association for the Advancement of Science reviewed the decision:
> "We think the existence of such an instrument would place within reach much which, if not actually impossible, has been too close to the limits of human skill and endurance to be practically available"

However...
> "It is not possible for us to form any reasonable estimate of its cost, or its strength and durability"

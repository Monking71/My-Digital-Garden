### Database Design
**Conceptual Design**:
- See ER-Modelling
**Logical Design**
- The process of constructing a model of the data used in an enterprise based on a specific data model (e.g. relational), but independent of a particular DBMS and other physical considerations
**Physical Design**
- The process of producing a description of the implementation of the database on secondary storage; it describes the base relations, file organisations, and index design use to achieve efficient access to the data, and any associated integrity constraints and security measures
#### Critical Success Factors in DB Design
- Work interactively **with the users!**
- Follow a structured methodology throughout
- Employ a data-driven approach
- Incorporate structural and integrity considerations
- Combine conceptualisation, normalisation, and transaction validation techniques
- Use diagrams to represent data models
- Use a Database Design Language (DbDL) to represent additional data semantics
- Build a data dictionary to supplement the data model diagrams
#### Logical DB Design
Conceptual Model $\rightarrow$ Logical Model
1. Derive Relations
2. Validate Relations using normalisation
3. Validate relations against user transactions
4. Define integrity constraints
5. Review logical data model with user
6. (optional) Merge logical data models into global model
7. Check for future growth
##### Derive Relations
**Strong Entities**
- For each strong entity in the data model, create a relation that includes all the simple attributes of that entity
- For composite attributes, include only the constituent simple attributes
![strong entities.png|400](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/strong%20entities.png)

**Weak Entities**
- For each weak entity, create a relation with the primary key partially or full derived from each owner entity after all relationships with the owner entities have been mapped
![weak entities.png|400](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/weak%20entities.png)

**One-to-Many (1:\*) Binary Relationships**
- For each 1:\* binary relationship, the entity on the ‘one side’ is designated as the parent entity and the entity on the ‘many side’ is designated as the child entity. A copy of the primary key attribute(s) of the parent entity is placed in the relation for the child entity as a foreign key
![one-to-many binary.png|400](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/one-to-many%20binary.png)

**One-to-One (1:1) Binary Relationships**
More complex as the cardinality cannot be used to identify to parent and child identities in a relationship
- Instead, the participation constraints are used to decide whether
	- To represent the relationship by combining the entities involved into one relation or
	- by creating two relations and posting a copy of the primary key from one relation to the other
- Consider the following
	- **(a) Mandatory** participation on **both** sides
		- Combine entities into one relation and choose one of the primary keys of the entity to be primary key and the other as an alternate key
		- ![mandatory both one-to-one.png|400](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/mandatory%20both%20one-to-one.png)
	- **(b) Mandatory** participation on **one** side
		- The entity with optional participation is designated as the parent entity, and the entity with mandatory participation is designated as the child entity.
		- A copy of the primary key of the parent entity is places in the relation for the child entity
		- ![mandatory one one-to-one.png|400](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/mandatory%20one%20one-to-one.png)
	- **(c) Optional** participation on **both** sides
		- Arbitrary designation of the parent and child entities unless we can find out more about the relationship that can help a decision be made one way or the other
		- ![optional one-to-one.png|400](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/optional%20one-to-one.png)

**One-to-One (1:1) Recursive Relationships**
For 1:1 recursive relationships, follow the same rules for participation as in a 1:1 relationship

**Superclass/Subclass Relationships**
Identify superclass entity as the parent and the subclass entity as the child
There are options to represent such relationships depending on participation and disjoint constraints
![superclass-subclass.png|600](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/superclass-subclass.png)

**Many-to-Many (\*:\*) Binary Relationships**
Create a relation for the relationship with all the attributes of the relationship, with a copy of the primary key of the participating entities as foreign keys. These foreign keys will also form the primary key of the new relation
![many-to-many.png|500](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/many-to-many.png)

**Complex Relationships**
Create a relation to represent the relationship. Copy the primary key of the participating entities as foreign keys.
Any foreign keys that represent a ‘many’ relationship (for example, 1..\*, 0..\*) generally will also form the primary key of this new relation
![Complex.png|500](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/Complex.png)

**Multi-Valued Attributes**
Create a new relation for the multi-valued attribute with the primary key of the entity as a foreign key.
Unless the multi-valued attribute is itself an alternate key of the entity, the primary key of the new relation is the combination of the multi-valued attribute and the primary key of the entity
![multi-valued attributes.png|500](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/multi-valued%20attributes.png)
$\small\text{The branch could have more than one phone number!}$
##### Validate Relations with Normalisation
To validate the relations in the logical data model using normalisation to ensure that the set of relations has a minimal yet sufficient number of attributes necessary to support the data requirements of the enterprise
##### Validate Relations Against User Transactions
Attempt to perform the operations manually using the relations, and the primary key/foreign key links in the relations
If we are unable to perform a transaction manually, there must be a problem with the data model that must be resolved
##### Check Integrity Constraints
Identifying:
- Required data
- Attribute domain constraints
- Multiplicity
- Entity integrity
- Referential integrity
- General constraints
Referential integrity considerations when a tuple in parent relation is deleted:
- NO ACTION, CASCADE, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT, NO CHECK
##### Step 5 – Step 7
**Review the Logical Data Model with the User**
- Review the logical data model with the users to ensure that they consider the model to be a true representation of the data requirements of the enterprise
**Merge Logical Data Models into Global Model (Optional Step)**
- To merge logical data models into a single global logical data model that represents all user views of a database
**Check for Future Growth**
- To determine whether there are any significant changes likely in the foreseeable future and to assess whether the logical data model can accommodate these changes


#### Physical DB Design
Logical Model $\rightarrow$ Physical Model
1. Translate logical data model for target DBMS
2. Design file organisations and indexes
3. Design user views
4. Design security mechanisms
5. Consider the introduction of controlled redundency
6. Monitor and tune the operational system
##### Translate Logical Data Model for Target DBMS
**Design Base Relations**
From the data dictionary, produce the DbDL to define domains, default values, and null indicators
![Design base Relations.png|500](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/Design%20base%20Relations.png)
**Design Representation of Derived Data**
To decide how to represent any derived data present in the logical data model in the target DBMS
- Examine the logical data model and data dictionary, then produce a list of all the derived attributes
- Each derived attribute can be stored in the database or calculated every time it is needed
**Design General Constraints**
To design the general constraints for the target DBMS
- Some DBMS provide more facilities than others for defining enterprise constraints, Example:
![Design General Constraints.png|600](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/6.%20Logical%20Database%20Design/images/Design%20General%20Constraints.png)
##### Design File Organisations & Indexes
To determine \[optimal file organisations to store the base relations in and] the indexes that are required to achieve acceptable performance; that is, the way in which relations and tuples will be held on secondary storage
**Analyse Transactions**
To understand the functionality of the transactions that will run on the database and to analyse the import transactions
- Attempt to identify performance criteria, such as:
	- Transactions that run frequently and will have a significant impact on performance
	- Transactions that are critical to the business
	- Times during the day/week when there will be a high demand on the database (called the **peak load**)
**Choose file Organisations**
To determine an efficient file organisation for each base relation
- File organisations such as
	- Heap
	- Hash
	- Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM)
	- Some DBMSs may not allow selection of file organisations
**Choose Indexes**
To determine whether adding indexes will improve the performance of the system
- One approach is to keep tuples unordered and create as many secondary indexes as necessary
- Another approach is to order tuples in the relation by specifying a primary or clustering index
**Estimate Disk Space Requirements**
yeah
##### Design User Views
To design the user views that were identified during the Requirements Collection and Analysis stage of the database system development life-cycle
##### Design Security Measures
To design the security measures for the database as specified by the users
##### Consider the Introduction of Controlled Redundancy
- To determine whether introducing redundancy in a controlled manner by relaxing the normalisation rules will improve the performance of the system
##### Monitor and Tune the Operational System
- To monitor the operational system and improve the performance of the system to correct inappropriate design decisions or reflect changing requirements

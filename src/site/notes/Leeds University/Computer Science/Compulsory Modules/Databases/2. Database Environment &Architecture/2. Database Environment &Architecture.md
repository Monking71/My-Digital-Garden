**External**
- The user, completely independent of the database designer
***Conceptual***
- The schema for the database
	- The design of the tables, their relations
	- All the SQL that *makes* the database
**Internal**
- *Where* the data is, how to find it and how it is compressed
- The communications between the DBMS and the Database

#### Data Independence
![Data Independence.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/2.%20Database%20Environment%20&Architecture/images/Data%20Independence.png)**Logical Data Independence**
- Allows you to edit the database without needing to change anything in the External Schema
	- *Unless!* you $\color{red} \textit{remove}$ a column from a table
		- Then the External Schema will break
**Physical Data Independence**
- You can modify the Internal Schema massively without needing to change the Conceptual Schema
- If you:
	- Move the database to a new storage location (bigger hard drive)
	- Rearrange the layout of the files
	- Change the hashing algorithm
	- Change the compression techniques
- The conceptual level remains unchanged

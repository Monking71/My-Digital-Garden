**Why do we care?**
- How many users/database operations are accessing the database system at one time
- How sure are you that there won’t be any incidents affecting the data in the database? e.g. system crash, media failure, error in program? How about sabotage?
- DBMS provides concurrency control and database recovery
#### Transaction Support
**What is a transaction?**
- An action, or series of actions, carried out by a user or application, which reads or updates contents of a database
- Logical unit of work on the database
- An/The? Application program is a series of transactions with non-database processing in between
- Transforms the database from one consistent state to another, although consistency may be violated during transaction

- Can have one or two outcomes:
	- **Success** – the transaction commits and the database reaches a new consistent state
	- **Failure** – the transaction aborts, and the database must be restored to a consistent state before it is started
		- Such a transaction is rolled back or undone
- A committed transaction cannot be aborted
- An aborted transaction that is rolled back can be restarted later

#### Properties of Transactions
There are four basic (***ACID***) properties that define a transaction:
- **Atomicity** – ‘All or nothing’ property
- **Consistency** – Must transform the database from one consistent state to another
- **Isolation** – Partial effects of incomplete transactions should not be visible to other transactions
- **Durability** – Effects of a committed transaction are permanent and must not be lost because of later
#### Concurrency Control
The process of managing simultaneous operations on the database without having them interfere with one another
- Prevents interference when two or more users are accessing database simultaneously and at least one is updating data
- Although two transactions may be correct in themselves, interleaving of operations may produce an incorrect result
**Need for Concurrency Control**
Three examples of potential problems caused by concurrency:
- Lost update problem
- Uncommitted dependency problem
- Inconsistent analysis problem
##### Lost Update Problems
A successfully completed update is overridden by another user
![Lost Update Problem.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/9.%20Transaction%20Management/images/Lost%20Update%20Problem.png)
	- Loss of $T_{2}$’s update avoided by preventing $T_{1}$ from reading $\text{bal}_{x}$ until after update
##### Uncommitted Dependency Problem
Occurs when one transaction can see intermediate results of another transaction before it has committed
![Uncommitted Dependency Problem.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/9.%20Transaction%20Management/images/Uncommitted%20Dependency%20Problem.png)
	- Problem avoided by preventing $T_{3}$ from reading $\text{bal}_{x}$ until after $T_{4}$ commits or aborts
##### Inconsistent Analysis Problems
Occurs when a transaction reads several values but a second transaction updates some of them during the execution of the first
![Inconsistent Analysis Problem.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/9.%20Transaction%20Management/images/Inconsistent%20Analysis%20Problem.png)
	- Problem avoided by preventing $T_{6}$ from reading $\text{bal}_{x}$ and $\text{bal}_{z}$ until after $T_{5}$ completed updates
##### Serialisability
The objective of a concurrency control protocol is to schedule non-interfering transactions
- Serialisability as a means of helping to identify those executions of transactions that are guaranteed to ensure consistency, as if the transactions are run in serial execution
**Why all these troubles? Recovery!**
- If a transaction in a schedule fails, it should be undone
- The DBMS does not test for serialisability of a schedule as the interleaving of operations is determined by the OS
- DBMS $\rightarrow$ concurrency control techniques to achieve serialisability
##### Concurrency Control Techniques
Two basic concurrency control techniques
- Locking
- Time-stamping
Both are conservative approaches: delay transactions in case they conflict with other transactions
Optimistic methods assume conflict is rare and only check for conflicts at commit
###### Locking
Transactions use locks to deny access to other transactions and to therefore prevent incorrect updates
Two types
- **Shared lock** for reading a data item
- **Exclusive lock** for both reading & writing a data item
Reads cannot conflict, so more than one transaction can hold shared locks simultaneously on the same item
**Exclusive lock** gives a transaction exclusive access to that item
Some systems allow transactions to upgrade a **shared lock** to an **exclusive lock**, or downgrade an **exclusive lock** to a **shared lock**

**Locks are used in the following way**:
- Any transaction that need to access a data item must first lock the item
- If the item is not already locked by another transaction, the lock will be granted
- If the item *is* locked, the DBMS determines whether the request is compatible with the existing lock. If a shared lock is requested on an item with a shared lock, the request will be granted; otherwise, the transaction must wait until the existing lock is released
- A transaction continues to hold a lock until it explicitly release it. It is only when the exclusive lock has been released that the effects of the write operation will be made visible to other transactions
###### Two-Phase Locking (2PL)
A transaction follows the 2PL protocol if all locking operations precede the first unlock operations in the transaction
**Two phases for the transaction**:
- ***Growing Phase*** – acquires all locks but cannot release any locks
- ***Shrinking Phase*** – releases the locks but cannot acquire any new locks

**Cascading Rollback**
If every transaction in a schedule follows 2PL, the schedule is serialisable
- However, problems can occur with the interpretation of when locks can be released
![Cascading Rollback.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/9.%20Transaction%20Management/images/Cascading%20Rollback.png)
$T_{14}$ aborts, since $T_{15}$ is dependent of $T_{14}$, $T_{15}$ must also be rolled back. Since $T_{16}$ is dependent on $T_{15}$, it too must be rolled back
**To prevent this with 2PL, you can:**
- ***Rigorous 2PL*** $\rightarrow$ Leave the release of **all** locks until the end of the transaction
- ***Strict 2PL*** $\rightarrow$ Hold only the **exclusive locks** until the end of the transaction
###### Deadlock
An impasse that may result when two (or more) transactions are each waiting for locks held by the other to be released
![Deadlock.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/9.%20Transaction%20Management/images/Deadlock.png)
There is only one way to break a deadlock: Abort all but one of the transactions
A deadlock should be transparent to the user, so the DBMS should restart the transaction(s)
However, in practice the DBMS cannot restart the aborted transaction since it is unaware of transaction logic even if it was aware of the transaction history (unless there is no user input in the transaction or the input is not a function of the database state)

**Three general techniques for handling a deadlock:**
- Timeouts
	- A transaction that requests a lock will only wait for a system defined period of time
	- If the lock has not been granted within this period, the lock request times out
	- In this case, the DBMS assumes the transaction may be deadlocked, even though it may not be, and it aborts and automatically restarts the transaction
- Deadlock prevention
	- The DBMS looks ahead to see if the transaction would cause a deadlock and never allows a deadlock to occur
**Deadlock detection and recovery**
The DBMS allows the deadlock to occur but recognises it and breaks it
- Usually handled by the construction of a wait-for graph (WFG) showing transaction dependencies
	- Create a node for each transaction
	- Create edge $T_{a}\rightarrow T_{b}$ if $T_{a}$ if waiting to lock an item locked by $T_{b}$
- A deadlock exists if and only if the WFG contains a cycle
![Deadlock WFG.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/9.%20Transaction%20Management/images/Deadlock%20WFG.png)
**Recovery**
There are several issues:
- Choice of the deadlock victim
	- How long has the transaction been running?
	- How many data items have been updated?
	- How many data items still need to be updated?
- How far to rollback a transaction?
- Avoiding starvation
	- Don’t make the same transaction a victim every time!
###### Time-stamping
A different approach to locking, with timestamps
- Transactions are ordered globally so that older transactions will smaller timestamps, get priority in the event of conflict
- Conflict is resolved by rolling back and restarting the transaction. No locks so no deadlock
- **Time-stamp**
	- A unique identifier that indicates the relative starting time of a transaction
	- Generated by using the system clock, or a logical counter
- A read/write will proceed only if the last update on that data item was carried out by an older transaction
- Otherwise, the transaction requesting the read/write is restarted and given a new timestamp
- Also timestamps for data items:
	- **read_timestamp** – The timestamp of the last transaction to read the item
	- **write_timestamp** – The timestamp of the last transaction to write to the item

**Basic Timestamp Ordering**
Consider a transaction ${\color{lightgreen} T}$ with timestamp $ts({\color{lightgreen} T})$ requesting to $read({\color{red} x})$
- $ts({\color{lightgreen} T}) < write\_timestamp({\color{red} x})$
	- ${\color{red} x}$ is already updated by a younger (later) transaction
	- The transaction must be aborted and restarted with a new timestamp
- Otherwise, update $read\_timestamp({\color{red} x})$

Consider a transaction ${\color{lightgreen} T}$ with timestamp $ts({\color{lightgreen} T})$ requesting to $write({\color{red} x})$
- $ts({\color{lightgreen} T}) < read\_timestamp({\color{red} x})$
	- ${\color{red} x}$ is already read by a younger transaction
	- Roll back the transaction and restart it using a later timestamp
- $ts({\color{lightgreen} T}) < write\_timestamp({\color{red} x})$
	- ${\color{red} x}$ is already written by a younger transaction
	- Roll back the transaction and restart it using a later timestamp
- Otherwise update $write\_timestamp({\color{red} x})$

**Strict time-stamping…**
When writing or reading, the transaction must also wait for the last transaction to write to the data item to abort/commit to avoid a cascading rollback

**Thomas’ Write Rule**
A variation to the basic timestamp ordering protocol that increase concurrency by relaxing strict serialisability
- Thomas’ write rule is that the write can safely be ignored – ignore obsolete write rules
	- When the current transaction wants to update a value that has been updated by a younger transaction, that write operation can be ignored and the current transaction does not need to be aborted

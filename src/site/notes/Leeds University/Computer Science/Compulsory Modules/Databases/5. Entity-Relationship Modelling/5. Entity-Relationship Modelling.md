**The Life-cycle**
![Database System Development Lifecycle.png|400](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/5.%20Entity-Relationship%20Modelling/images/Database%20System%20Development%20Lifecycle.png)
**Conceptual Database Design**
- The process of constructing a model of the data used in an enterprise, independent of all physical considerations
#### Building the *Conceptual Model*
1. Identify Entities
2. Identify Relationships
3. Identify and associate Attributes with Entities or Relationships
4. Determine Attribute Domains
5. Determine Keys
6. Consider enhanced modelling
   (optional step)
7. Check model for redundancy
8. Validate model against user transactions
9. Review data model with user
##### Entity-Relationship Modelling
- Entity-relationship modelling analyses data requirements in a systematic way to help produce a well-designed database
- ER modelling should always be completed before  you implement your database
- Everything is modelled in terms of three basic concepts: *Entity*, *Attribute*, *Relationship*
###### Notations
**UML (Unified Modelling Language)**
![UML.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/5.%20Entity-Relationship%20Modelling/images/UML.png)
**Chen’s Notation**

**Crow’s Feet Notation**

**Others**
- Bachman Notation, Barker’s Notation, IDEF1X, etc…
###### ***Entity***
A group of objects with the same properties (Attributes), having an independent existence
- Physical entity (Car, Staff, Product, Influencer)
- Conceptual entity (Timetable, Sale, Viewing, Spending)
- Entity occurrence or instance of an entity
	- Uniquely identifiable instance of an entity such as Nigel Ng (Uncle Roger) is an instance of the entity Influencer
**Strong Entity**: An entity that *is not* existence-dependent another entity
**Weak Entity**: An entity that *is* existence-dependent on another entity
###### ***Attribute***
A property of an entity or a relationship
- Attribute Domain
	- A set of allowable values for one or more attributes
	- e.g. Age, 1 to 150 years
- Example: An Influencer entity with attributes firstName and lastName
**Simple Attribute**: An attribute composed of a single component with an independent existence,
e.g. ID
**Composite Attribute**: An attribute composed of multiple components, each with an independent existence,
e.g. deliveryAddress can be subdivided into Street, City and Postcode
**Derived Attribute**: An attribute that represents a value that is derivable from a value of a related attribute, or set of attributes, not necessarily in the same entity,
e,g, Age can be calculated from DOB
###### ***Relationship***
Entities take part in relationships.
- Identify relationships from **verbs** or **verb phrases**
- A set of meaningful associations among entities
- Shown as a line connecting associated entities together with the name of the relationship
- Example: a student **registers** a course
![Relationship.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/5.%20Entity-Relationship%20Modelling/images/Relationship.png)
**Degree of a Relationship**
The number of participating entities in a relationship
**Unary** (degree 1) - One entity
**Binary** (degree 2) - Two entities
**Ternary** (degree 3) - Three entities
**Quaternary** (degree 4) - Four entities
***N*-ary** (degree 5) - *n* entities
###### Step 1: Identify Entity (types)
- Examine user’s requirements specification
- Identity nouns or noun phrases,
  e.g. Staff Number, Staff Name, Property Number
- Look for major objects, such as People, Places or Concepts of Interest, excluding nouns that are Attributes
- Look for objects with an independent existence
- If possible, the users should be involved
- Document entities in a data dictionary

| Entity Name | Description | Aliases  | Occurence |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| **Staff**   | …           | Employee | …         |
|             |             |          |           |
###### Step 6: Identify Relationships
- Look for **verbs** or **verb phrases**
- Determine multiplicity constraints (section 3) of relationships
- Document relationships

| Entity Name | Multiplicity | Relationship | Multiplicity | Entity Name         |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
| **Staff**   | 0..1         | *Manages*    | 0..100       | **PropertyForRent** |
$\small0\leftrightarrow1\text{ Staff Manages }0\leftrightarrow100\text{ PropertForRent}$
**Many-to-Many** (\*..\*) $\implies$ ***BAD!***
Create a Composite Entity:
![Composite Entity.png](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/5.%20Entity-Relationship%20Modelling/images/Composite%20Entity.png)
###### Step 3: Identify Attributes
Look for **nouns** or **noun phrases** that are a property, quality, identifier, or characteristic of entities or relationships
- Document the attributes in a data dictionary

| Entity Name | Attributes   | Description | Data Type & Length    | Nulls? | Multi-valued? |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| **Staff**   | staffNo<br>… | …           | 5 variable characters | No     | No            |
###### Step 5: Determine Keys
Identify the candidate key(s) for an entity and then select the primary key
Some general guideline in choosing a primary key:
- The key with the minimal set of attributes
- The key with values least likely to change
- The Key with the fewest characters or smallest maximum value
- The key that is easiest to use from the user’s point of view
Document the keys
###### Step 7: Check Model for Redundancy
- Re-examine one-to-one (1..1) relationships
	- Merge entities if needed
- Removed redundant relationships
	- Between same entities
- Consider time dimensions
	- Potential influence in the future
###### Step 8: Validate Model with User Transactions
- Attempt to perform the operations manually using the model
- Can all transactions be done? If not, there must be a problem with the model

##### Problems with ER Models
Problems may arise when designing a conceptual data model called connection traps
- Often due to a <u>misinterpretation of the meaning of certain relationships</u>
- Two main types of connection traps are called **fan traps** and **chasm traps**
###### Fan Trap
This is where a model represents a relationship between entity types, but **the pathway between certain entity occurrences is ambiguous**
- A fan trap may exists where two or more 1:* relationships fan out from the same entity

![fan trap.png|700](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/5.%20Entity-Relationship%20Modelling/images/fan%20trap.png)
At which branch does staff number SG37 work?
**Remove Fan Trap:**

SG37 works at branch B003
###### Chasm Trap
This is where a model suggests the existence of a relationship between entity types, but a pathway does not exist between certain entity types
- May occur with relationships with a minimum multiplicity of 0 forming part of the pathway between related entities

![chasm trap.png|700](/img/user/Leeds%20University/Computer%20Science/Compulsory%20Modules/Databases/5.%20Entity-Relationship%20Modelling/images/chasm%20trap.png)
At which branch office is property PA14 available?

**Remove Chasm Trap**

*The science and art of selecting and interconnecting components to create computers that meet functional cost and performance goals*

Architecture: the attributes visible to the programmer - software??
	- *Intel x86, ARM64, IBM System/370*
	- Allows for backwards compatibility
1. Instruction set
2. Number of bits used for data representation
3. I/O Mechanisms
4. Addressing Techniques
Organisation: how the architecture is implemented - hardware??
	- Differs between different versions
1. Control signals
2. Interfaces
3. Memory technology

Computers are very complex, this is simplified by considering a hierarchical structure
each levels the system consists of a set of components and their interrelationships
the behaviour at each level depends on a simplified, abstracted characterisation of the system at the next level down.

### Four basic functions of a computer
- Data movement
- Data storage
- Data processing
- Control
